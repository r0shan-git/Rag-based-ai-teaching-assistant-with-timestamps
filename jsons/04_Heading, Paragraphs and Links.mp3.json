You can write the heading in your web page We talked about basic structure We said that it is HTML HTML Lang is equal to EN It is the value of the attribute of the language In English, this is the search engine Or if any of the link of this web page is in the description You can parse the web page from the search engine You can also find out that your web page is in English Here is the header, which is in the metadata, which is title, which is in the description The link of CSS is in the description Body is in the main content Now the tag is in the tag that is in the name of H1 And I will write the code in the description If I write here, I will write the code in the description So we will write H1 tags And if I want to live here I will click here And after that I will do an open and browser See this is showing my bookmarks in this way Now why should we always use H1? I directly wrote my bookmark Because I will tell the browser This is my heading and this is my first level heading Now I will choose the second level heading in my bookmarks I want to write a main bookmark and a secondary bookmark So I will use H2 That is, the second level heading So if you write it in your book, if you have a word use Then you will know what H1H2 is I will tell you the main level heading And the second level heading It is from H2 I will say the main bookmarks And the secondary bookmarks I will do something like this And I will do something like this I will do an alt shift And I will do an alternate script I will do a screen cast mode So I have done an alternate script And this is the replicate This is the shortcut of the VS code I want to tell you the shortcut of VS code And you will be able to map where you will now click Make a hazard But I do change the prompt In this timeline, I need to take all the spur marks I try Erase both Do as I was explaining I did good And press Alt in this Lets session And I will get multiple targets I will type multiple concerts and I will type the concerts there. I will like this. I will drop some of these concerts and you will see this update. This is my main heading. This is my H2. From H1 to H2, we have H6th heading. You can say that you have given the main heading. After the main heading, you have given a second heading. Then you have to give the heading inside. And so on. You have to give a lot of sub-headings. You can give the H6th heading. H6th is more than enough. You can use H6th in HTML. You will never have to use H7th. You can use H6th in practical life. And if you study, you can use H6th in repeat. Because it is so small that you will have a small chance of H6th. You will have to go to small chance. I will do this. I will replicate the old shift. And I will do this. I will do this. This is all the shortcuts. So that you guys have a lot of productivity. Now I have put two cuts here. I will do the back space h3. Then I will do all the double. I will do this. And I will do this. I will do this h5. Now I will do this. I will do this. So H6th is more than enough. Now I will write here using H1. So that you guys know. I will write here using. I will write here using H. And now I will do this. So that Huks is not broken. PS4, PS6.. UE4 and PS4. PS6 is more than enough. So this is msTC which means that YQ is more than Ancient\u6a5f\u95a3. What do I do now? In KX Primary, if wey, fij isworking to this album. And H2 is faster. Okay. I have used H2 and H2 in H3. I have also used H2 in H3. Here, why the term hypertext and markup language is heading 2. What is the main heading page of H2 and H2? After this, all these are the writing. I had no exercise in it, so I used H3 in it. Then I got into H2. Because the hierarchy that is built in H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, etc. They are there. I hope you all understood. If you are commenting on this, you are starting very slow. I am making this course as a beginner course. When I tell people in HTML, then you all have a little bit of a habit. Then I will tell you a little about this. Then I will come to Javascript, then I will come to the library. Then I will come to the bootstrap. This will also go to the library. Then I will react. Then I will note the notes. Then I will go to the library and write something. I will write the number of notes. Then after that, I will go to the level. I told them, I will write the number of notes. When we react, we will do things that will be done in the project. Then I will ask them to comment. I will tell you what is the level. Don't talk about the level. The level will be raised. This is the heading. I will write the 6 addings. Now we want to write a paragraph. You can use P tag. P will enter the paragraph. I will tell you a shortcut trick. If you want to play a dummy in the VS code, what will you do? You write the law ram here. I wrote the law ram 23. See here, the M at abbreviation is here. This is the law ram 23. I will give 23 words. Something like this. You can trap the word on the view. You will not get the horizontal straw bar. So, you can trap the view. Now, you see here, the law ram is an absent dollar set. Here, this is a dummy text. Why do we want dummy text? That is why we want to make template. And we want to fill the template with something. We want to make a website that shows the OEO rooms. Now, OEO become a member. OEO for business. I don't want to write here. I wrote the law ram here. I want to write something here. I write 7 words with the law ram. I will write the law ram 7. I will give the OEO people. They will write it. You can use this in the placeholder. My plan is that we will make popular websites. You will know how to do this. This is also a popular website. If you use these services, you must write in the comment section. Now, we will see the next thing. Paragraph is a paragraph. You have to style it. And all these things are made through CSS. Paragraph, you can see here, I wrote the law ram 23. I will enter here. I will write the law ram 10. I will write the law ram 100. I will write the law ram. I can do that too. This law ram value is very good. You will enjoy it. Whenever we will make popular websites, I will make Amazon.in. I will make Amazon.in. I have to write something here. I will write the law ram 3. I will not think about the makeup products. I will write the law ram 4. I will write the law ram 2. I will make it and then do the review. I will also come to my database and I will bring my index time. Many people asked me, what is this course job ready? The answer is yes. This course is going to be ready. Absolutely, I will make it like this. I will make it like this. You will get the job of the actual industry level and the learning of this course. Now, let's talk about the attributes in HTML. These attributes are in HTML. As I used HTML tag, the language is equal to the attribute. In the body, we did not use the attribute. In HTML, we did not use the attribute. I can use a PMAX style attribute. The online CSS is also called, I will red the background color. It is something like this. The background color is red. It also says online CSS. If you add CSS, we have to add CSS here. If you add style, you will get the background red here. I will show you this red red background. You can do it. I will do this till I get the background red. This color is already looking good. I can also add style inline. When you create an online style, we use it very less. It becomes maintainability. It becomes reusability. We want to shift a small bundle on browser. Our website is more optimized. We avoid all these things. But in the online CSS, there is a style tag. Here, there is a style attribute. It is a tag, a P tag is an attribute style. Through which we can style this element. We will read about more attributes. We will give an enhanced functionality to an element. This is the paragraph we gave to a style. The background color was yellow. We used this style attribute to give this background color. We used this type of attribute to give properties. Like we talked about the link. We talked about the link of the CSS. The link is relic attribute. We can use this type of attribute to add style. We can use CSS style sheet to add background color. We will use this type of attribute to add background color. We will use this type of attribute to add background color. And don't take attention. It is all about how to handle it. I will show you the hot pink. Let me show you how to use this type of code. This is also a functionality. It is very less. Overgarove mouse. You can choose the color you want. I will show you how to use this type of code. You can choose the color of body background color. I will write the ninja technique in the comment section. Now we have come back to index.html. I can open it. I will comment on this type of style sheet. Which is very natural. The background color was reduced from this style sheet. This background color was coming from the CSS. This is very natural. I have made this style sheet. I have made this style sheet. Now we are going to make a bookmark manager. Bookmark manager.html. I am making this a different file. I have told you about the other items. I am going to make a useful bookmark manager. I will show you how to make bookmark manager. Now you guys know why this bookmark manager is making this in Chrome. This is our hand. This is our child. This is our child. We will make this in the next page. You will make this one software. You will make this one software. You can see here. I will write here. I will write here. I will write here. I will write here. This is my bookmark. I will write here. I will show you all. Post trouve a Path of Library. I will do this many days later. Do not guess what to think. Now you have to remember to write this bookmark in Rule. Now I will write this bookmark. Now I will write in clouds checking link plates. I will use the AnkerTak I will enter in A, and then enter an Editor attribute I will click on the link of HRF I will click HRF STTPS colon double slash www.google.com I will click on the open google I will cut the open google and put it here I will put the content stack here You can see that HRF is open google I will make links to the AnkerTak You can see that I will enter the bookmark manager.html You can see that I will click on the open google You can see that I will click on the open google I did not click on the blue button I have visited it The color changed The color changes when you visit it I have seen a visited link I have visited it I will tell you one more If I click on the new tab I will click on it If you want to open it If you want to click on other one You can use this attribute You can click on the target is I have written a simple open google You can find the website of your favourite You can find it on your own I have written a good website I will write open facebook You can find facebook.com I will write it in my own way And then we will write it in my own way Let's write it in my own way YouTube.com Let's see You can see that it is coming in one line If you want it to be in one line, then what will you do? You will put it in your own paragraph It is a very dirty way I am saying it dirty, I will tell you But close it in paragraph If you want, I will shift the right arrow I will control the right arrow Then I will go in all the cutters Because if you go in the end, it will go in the end And I will control it I have shot a lot and you will get a lot of people like this What is this? If you don't go in the end But I have simply done that the functionality of VS Code is used Multiple cutters functionality I have got multiple cutters and I have used them This is not a good idea, we use it in paragraph We don't even get a list, we make a list Because we don't have a list, we use paragraph But this will work for us This will look like something And the one we have not visited is blue We have visited Facebook, and this color is also purple So now it is your primary bookmark Which of your second bookmarks are you? We are the second bookmarks Second bookmarks are yours Which you will visit anytime Follow wikipedia.com We have become wikipedia.com And we will write the stack overflow We will write the stack overflow We will capitalize the stack overflow And you can see the second bookmarks Your wikipedia and stack overflow So your bookmark manager is done And you can make this bookmark manager better If you are learning from CSS, then you can see this next So don't worry, this is a big mistake Don't worry, we will do the time-telling We will do the time-telling, we will talk about all these things Now you can see the bookmark in the way The bookmark manager is your title And I will write it in H1 So both of them are the same I mean the title is the same And my bookmarks will also be written here So you can make a bookmark manager from this way You can use it in actual use You can save it in some way Like I have got this bookmark manager on RdHT You can put it on your desktop Whenever you open a website, you will simply double click If you double click on VS code, then you have to do it right You have to open it open with open with You have to wrap the choose and app And then you have to choose Google Chrome And then you have to choose Google Chrome And then you have to always choose Google Chrome So whenever I double click on Google Chrome, it will open with Google Chrome So this is our bookmark manager I hope you like it I have requested it from you Today our 4 videos are complete If you like a code that you share with your friends I know you will share it very less But if you will do it, then it increases my courage And I will try to get more and more of these more Many people are saying that how are these codes free? How are you going to do it? I will find the ways to make more money But the thing is that this is the way I am going to do this This is the biggest code of web development I will put everything in this You will get less time and you will learn more I have been very late to get a lot of updates I had told all the companies that I would launch this And make our platform I will not say that many companies are late And they told me that I would launch this as a paid course Why are you doing this? You will regret your decision But hopefully I will not regret my decision To make this code free I will make money in the same way And I will also teach you this code How can you earn money through web development? With that said, I will put the description in And I will give you the source code of this code You can get it from the repository Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Bye bye"}
