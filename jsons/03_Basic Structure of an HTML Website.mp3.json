You guys are back in Sigma Web Development course. I am really happy that you guys have given so much love to this course. You guys like this high energy. Because for Sigma Free course, this is the likes of Sigma Chats. In today's video, I will explain to you guys basic structure. I will explain to you guys in a website. In that website, you guys will learn a mobile trick. You will learn that you can preview your phone from your website. You guys can tell me in the comments section that you can get HTML or not. That will help me structure this course better. In this video, I will explain the impact of 4GBD. Because it is very fast about 4GBD. In the coming videos, I will also give you guys quizzes. So learn this video carefully and understand all the concepts. Let's go to the computer screen and let's roll the internet. So guys, I am in the computer screen. Now we will talk about how to use the object text, the structure of the object text. So here, I will make a new folder in my folder. I will open the video and click on the open width code. And you guys can see that my theme is blue color. And many people said that blue is not good. Look, the theme is the choice of your choice. If you want to change the color theme, then you can change the color theme. I will use the dark color of the grid up. You can use dark color. For a new file, I will add index.html. We already talked about this. Here, I will write the title of the page and the content. And then I will use the link tag. I can use the MET and write the style.css. That's why I am taking it. And if I write the script.js here. And then I will write the alert from the alert. So I will not tell you the exact same thing. Here, I have put the script tag here. I have just put the script in the body. Then I will put the script in the form of the script.js. And then I will click here and open width browser. So this will come here. And if I write the background red here, then it will be red. I will not tell you all this. Because I have already told you guys. I will tell you guys now that what is the structure of this structure? Why did you write so much? This is a doubt. We can write the title and the content directly. What is the need to write so much? So I will tell you how much you need to write. I will reload it. Look, the content here is here. It is red here. Now you will see that I need to reload the page. Some people ask me why to reload the page. When I reload the page already. So I changed the CSS file. When I change CSS file, I need to reload at the time. If you are using HTML file, you are changing it. You will not need to reload the changes of HTML file. Now I will come back and I will explain. This is a basic structure. We write HTML website. First of all, we write the doc type HTML. Then write HTML tag. Look, this HTML tag is opening tag or closing tag. This is the opening tag of the body or closing tag. This is the opening tag or closing tag of the head. This is the content of the head. HTML content is the content of the head. The title content is the content of the head. Now what is the content of the head? The head is a self closing tag. There are two types of tags in HTML. One is self closing tag. And the other is the pair tag. What is the pair tag? The opening tag is the closing tag. This is the basic structure HTML website. Now you will see that background red is the background red. This is the background red. This is the background red. If I remove the CSS file from here and say it quickly. What will I say? Remove it quickly. And as I will say it quickly. I will have to remove it from here. I will reload the page. You can see here that it is removed. In this way, I can also say JavaScript. Remove it quickly. You can see that I have also become an alert. Okay. So you can also reload it. So this is an alert. This HTML content in CSS and JavaScript was added. This is additionally CSS and JavaScript functionalities. We used this HTML page to link it. And I already told you about the title tag. This is used to set the page title. Now it is not necessary to give you the title here. The search engines use this. The search engines are Google. If you will write here code with Harry HTML. So code with Harry's HTML introduction, HTML working. All the titles I have added are in the background. You can see here the HTML introduction is the title of the page. So these titles are used in search engines and parsed. Now I will change the page. So HTML working is the title. Now I will change the page. You can see here the HTML installation is the title. So titles are changed. As I will change it, it will be changed. As you can see. So HTML pages have not been used only for title. You can see here. This is also used in SEO. And let's tell you what is the content in the page. These people describe the page content. So I am knowing what is the HTML execution. What is the HTML execution? How does HTML execute? So the title of the page is very good. So we will make a website from any framework. We will change the page title. Now here the head section. The title of the page is the metadata. You can see the title. And you can see the link to the conscript. You can see the link to the conscript. And also the meta tags. I will tell you about them. The meta tags are basically the document. HTML document is about the description. The meta description is a very important keyword. You can write it in the page. If you go to my website, you will get a view of the page. The meta description tag is in the video. You can see the meta description tag. If you talk about Google, the meta description is in the video. I want to show you the document. The document is in the header. The tag is in the header. The tag is in the header. The tag is in the header. You can also put the tag in the header. And what differences will I talk about in the course? I used the link to use CSS. The main content of the page is the main content. If you put the bot in the text you will get a result. For latest meta tags, you will get a result with the top basic structure. In the New Music, there are Most of the content in the body is made up of HTML and you copy it. You copy the source code from the website. If I talk about the forms, then you copy it in the HTML form. And you will start making your form and modify it. So, copy paste is very important to me. As a senior developer, you should know where to copy paste and when to copy. I am not saying it is just a sarcasticly. You will always be the same. You copy paste it or copy paste it. You will also prefer to copy paste it. Because this is going to change the form. And if you copy paste, you will save your time. Then innovation is not a copy paste. So, as a sigma rule, you will copy paste it. And you will have to copy paste. And when you want to copy paste, you will have to save your time. The most important part of being a senior software developer is to where to copy paste from. Which stack of our people who are asking to copy paste from. And how to paste it from where copyright code with that is. 2,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, whatever you understand. This is my copy statement. I have told you and this statement is very important. Now, I will tell you about a technique that you will develop on this website. You will be able to see it in this mobile. Now, listen to the steps. Click terminal. And click IP config. If you are in the old version, you can open command prompt or power shell. You will get IP config like enter and hit enter. You will see here. You will get IPv4 address. 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 9 9. Now, I will copy this IP address here. So, I will copy this IPv4 address. And I will write in my settings. Live preview. This local IP host address to host your files on this place. I will write it on its place. And after doing this, I will restart my VS code. You will have to ensure that you go to your Wi-Fi settings. You can network your network with private network. You should not network public. You should not network private. You should connect Wi-Fi to your connected network. You will get a show preview. You will get a slash index.html. You can use this on your phone. I will put this IP address here quickly. I will put 1 9 2.168.1.199. You can get a call in 5000. You can get a call in 3000. You can also get your port. And you will see here. The website is previewed in mobile. This trick is very useful when we want to preview in mobile. Today, we will see more websites in phone. We will try to use our phone. It can be a good way to use our website. And we will do a development in computer. That will be a good way to test. If you have not put a review in the first video, I will request you to review your course. I have told you in the last video that you should review it. I will put a initial review. You write the initial review. As you can see, the initial review will be known. What is the initial review of this course? Start with 5. Access the playlist description. Click on the star. You will get a bookmark. You will get a show in the bookmarks. I have booked a sigma web development course. Click on the star. You will get a save. I have access to less people. I want all of you to access this playlist. Bookmark and save the playlist. So, access the playlist. Like the video. And share it with your friends. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."}
