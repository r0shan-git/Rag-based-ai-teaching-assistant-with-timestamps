    "text": " Last video, you guys loved it so much It's my pleasure to keep this course free It's a like for this free course When I started web development It was not a comprehensive course Free or paid, it was not a course So I can understand the free course How much money does it take to get free? And trust me, I'll live up to the expectations With that said, I'll like this video Because in this video, we'll be making our first website In this video, I'll be making an iPhone 15 Pro Max Order And why? What kind of words will it take to get this video? For many people, your first website of your life So it's going to be fun You guys are excited to do so Write in the comment section, I'm excited And in the comment section, I'll write all the comments I'll give you a heart In this video, we'll learn how to link HTML website to CSS and JavaScript Along with that, I'll give you guys notes, cheat sheet and a lot of resources I'll tell you some of the such textings Because I've learnt in the years And you'll get 10x speed of your web development We'll also see in this video, how to make your VS code awesome That your VS code will look like a killer In this video, I'll tell you how to earn money from your web development So let's start with full energy Let's roll the intro Alright guys, so we've already started our video stream Before we start the video, you guys should know that you need to access the playlist Secondly, we are very close to 5 billion subscribers So if you haven't subscribed yet, then don't forget to subscribe In today's video, we'll tell you how to make your first VS code First, we'll use the VS code This is the folder we started our web development series I want to give you guys this web development series source code So I'll configure the gate You guys don't have to know the gate But I'll fire the gate hub desktop And I'll do a new repository I'll add and create a new repository My name is Sigma WebDevCodes And this is my folder, so I'll select this folder Initialize this repository with the grade And I'll write the source code for Sigma WebDevelopment Codes I'll create a repository So you'll get a repository, which is called Sigma WebDevCodes First, I'll put all the relevant things in the video These were the first two files relevant So I'll name this video one I'll create a new folder in one place And I'll move both the files to one folder I'm not pushing all the videos on the gate You can use the sample videos So whatever source code I'll update here And I'll keep pushing on the gate How do I push on the gate? You guys don't need to learn this But this procedure is very simple Why do you use the gate? I want to tell you that the gate is used by web developers They use general coders When they want to collaborate with other people So what will happen? You'll work with many programmers And those programmers will collaborate with your source code And to collaborate like this They'll also push some code You'll also push some code I'll also create a file If you're creating a file, then you'll get a GitHub use And what is the GitHub Desktop? The GitHub Desktop is a utility to use it The GitHub is open source of the GitHub Microsoft's own company Which is used to use the GitHub repository It helps to host web interface In the future videos, I'll tell you more But I'm just pushing the repository On the code with the GitHub account You'll get a link in the description So as soon as I'll give you the link You'll get all the code And I'll talk about this I'm making this video a course I'm making an impact To follow the absolute beginners I'll click on the publish repository This code will be called a sync From my GitHub account, all the codes I'll upload It will go to my GitHub account And it will be a sync The changes will be there If you change them, I can pull them Click and then do a fetch I can pull them I'll teach you a video ready-git Don't worry I'll do this So that I can give you the code I'll make a video to name it I'll go inside this video I'll click on Shift And open with VS code This option will be available If you have installed VS code If you have done some changes And you haven't checked it If you have seen it, you can solve it We'll do this We'll dismiss the notification I'll make a file I'll make an index-storage And that file will be here So I'll know all of it All the intermediate people who are saying We already know all of them But I'll make this code for you Along with all the beginners So I'll make three files I'll make index.html I'll make a style.css And I'll make a style.js Script.js And this file can be called as well But I want to keep this file self-explanatory Because I'll see what it is doing What is doing in index.html Script.js Style.css It's a style sheet I've made three files I'll make an index.html And I'll make an exclamation You can see the code is here I'll click on View So you can see the code It's going to be removed from the code I've checked the code You can see The code is here Now you can understand We'll use this code To make a website Now you can see the extension In the tab Extensions Any function of VS code is used We use the extension To make the VS code better We use the extension of VS code We use the code to make a style So we'll use the extension First, I'll add a bit of extension So we'll use the extension The way our VS code is killer You can see the result If you've seen it, you can see it I'll do it quickly I'll use the extension of VS code I'll use the extension of VS code To make the extension You can see The files you see You can see the first file You can see the video You can see the icons Thanks for installing VS code icons I'll activate it You can see and observe with the icons Now you wanna see the position of Rise This icon looks good k\u00f6content from Walls You can follow both the rules It's James de\u043d\u044b\u0435 What is interesting is you can keep dreams Michael I just name this Now if I change my theme, then my VS Code will be different. I will show you which one I prefer when it comes to theme. First of all, I will show you the github theme. So github theme is officially called github. Here you can see the github dark, the github light, the github dimmed, the github color blind. I prefer the github dark, because the github light is the same as the github. Another thing I like about the github is jellyfish. Jellyfish is a very good theme for people. You can see the github from this side. The material theme is very popular. If I use the material theme, then I will show you which one I can change. I will show you which one I can change. I will show you which one I can use. If you want, you can use VS Code icons. I want the material theme icon to be removed. I will simply do this. I will show you which one I can use. I will use this one. I will do this. I will install this. I will do this on re-load. I will do this on re-load. I will do this on re-load. If you want to use this one. I will do this on re-load. I will show you which one I can use. I will show you which one I can use. I like this type of items. I like jellyfish theme. Next, there is an extension called Pretty AirHesco. I will not install this one. I want to show you. The other extension is e-S7. When I react, you will know. React as well as react in this course. Sorry for the spoilers, but we are going to react. So this is the ESE7 plus React Redux. React Native Snippers. We will use it now as a React. Now we will not install it. But the most important thing about our extension is the live preview. This live preview is the extension of our extension, because it is very low in extension. You can tell the extension in this much, You can change the view of the OS code But I will tell you the live preview You will use it in actual use Here are the HTML services on JavaScript files This is HTML file This is a code that tells you how to see the website I am saying that it should be in the title I will show you the first website The first map you need to find is Gr Housing You only need to print all Citrus Surround the code Right now click its front Its supports to help\u308b Curves Now, let's see how it is. First of all, there is a question for people. So, let's see these two things. We installed the extension in live server. The first live server was also running, but Microsoft released the live preview. So, I will recommend the latest joy extension. Even the Live server is running, but I will not run the Live server. I will use the live preview. After installing the live preview, you can see this icon. You will see this on your website. Now, you will say, I want to see this website here. Because, if you want to see this website in browser, then you can click here. If you want to see this browser, then click here. And, let me tell you one more thing. You can close it and you can write here. Here is the code of Harry. I am writing it. I am writing it on my own. But, yes, that is the code of Harry. Okay, I have written here. And you have noticed one thing. I did not do this website for the first time. But, after that, I have updated this content. I have written in the code of the code of the Jocke. I will write here. Without the reload, the date will be updated. Will it be? Save it. What is this? Okay, it will be. And, here, this is my first website. Harry is a good code. Now, I will write here. It is a good code of the SIGMA Harry. It is a good code of the SIGMA Harry. Okay, so, you have seen here. How to do this extension? If you reload it, it will not be a problem. Because, it is reloading. So, there are two things. Sometimes, we want our page to be the same. So, you can see the code. Sometimes, we want our code to be the same. Because, we want to see the same. I am writing something in the live preview. Harry is a good code. And, this is SIGMA. I will write something in the live preview. I can write all the things in the live preview. I can write here. I can write it in a small way. So, I will update the live preview. I have seen some videos of this extension. I have never seen this extension. I don't know what it is. Now, it is a new thing. But, this is something that you should use. Because, I use this in my daily life. I am doing web development. Many people ask me, You also do web development. You teach me. I also do web websites. I don't only make videos. I also do work. I also make websites. And, I also earn a lot of money. Now, all these things are written in the code. You will get all these things in the GitHub. You will go to any video in the video description. You will go to any video description. You will get the corresponding code in the video. You will get the voltage. I will turn it off. Because, my preview is here. Now, I have talked about some HTML CSS JavaScript. We talked about it so many times in the last video. Now, let me tell you how to link these three. Now, you can make a good index and HTML in your HTML. You can also see the title here. Here, you can see the first website of the course of the Harry-Bike. I will do a web development course. So, this will change. SIGMA. SIGMA. web development. Cores. You can see the Cores here. This is the update. This will be the update. Live update. Now, I want my background to be red. Okay. Let's go to CSS. I can write here body and background color red. Okay. This will be the syntax of CSS. I will read CSS and I will read it like this. I will not be able to say anything. Don't worry. Write it. We will write CSS to read the body color. Okay. And here, you can see that the body color will not be red. Comment section. I will tell you about the beginner's. Okay. Why not? Beginners will be asked to read. But it will not be red. It is not that good. This is HTML file is also running. I don't know about CSS file. What is going on in my house? What is my study? I know. I have made a Dal here. And I expect. I know my studies have made a Chambal. And I will expect. I am not able to eat it. I can eat it sometimes. But I have to go. I have to link. I will have to link. You have to go and read. I will tell you. I will make Dal. You want. I will have to make a Handshake. So, how will it be? How will it be? You will tell in HTML. Where is your file? So, it is a link tag. And not using not-pad. You will also know the reason. I will click here. I will click here. I will select the link. I will select it. I have made half of it. I have written it as a strategy. I have to type in Manoli. This is syntax. HTML is fine. I have to type in HTML. But automatically, I have to type the title. Here are the styles. I will make a Kismah. I have style. I have filed and here too. I have style. Here are the styles. Harry. Now, I write Harry. And guess what. I have background. Now, I want color. The color can be white. Now, I can write the color text here. I can write the color. I have written color white. Now, I have not taken any. I have written color white. I take this white. The valid syntax. Now we will talk about the CSS. How will we go to JavaScript? If I write here, I will write here, welcome to sigma web development course. I believe I will write here, welcome to sigma web development course. So what will be the alert? Why didn't I come here? Let me tell you that this syntax is absolutely correct. There is no problem in the syntax. And I will read a lot of JavaScript. So don't worry about this. The code of JavaScript, which is called, will flash very simple to the code of sigma web development. Why didn't I do it? It has flashed. Is my computer broken? No, my computer is absolutely correct. I want to tell you that I will have to include script. And let's include script. Let's just start with the body. Okay, now I will include script like here. I will write in this Rc. Script.js. How did I write? First of all, I wrote here script. Okay, first of all, I wrote here script. What is the limit abbreviation? The limit is a plugin, which is built in VS code. You will do the same. You will be able to complete your auto. I will write here script. And here I will write here C in SRC. So I will give you a source file. You can also type it manually. But you can write your code in these suggestions. Let's make the powers and the states. Let's make you a good developer. And let's make your powers bigger. The ones that you cannot get in the form of a song. And from the end of the day, your developer can be a good developer. SRC is equal to script.js. You can see here. I will include it. Now I will come here. Now I will come here and come to Sigma Web Development Course. Write in the comments below. Write it. Because I know that your smartness is a box. And the JavaScript is also gone. Css was gone. JavaScript is also gone. Now your smartness is gone. I will reload it. I will come back again. Okay, I will be able to complete it. So, as soon as I visit this website, I will see an alert. Let's say it's called alert. I will tell you what is the next one. Don't say it's an alert. I don't want to start it. I will finish this stream. Then I will say JavaScript. So don't take any tension. And with this, I will tell you the best practices. Because whatever I am telling you, it is coming from my experience. It is coming from a long time experience. And definitely you will help. As I said, you can use the live server. So, I think you can use it in that. I will tell you that you can use it in my Microsoft. Awesome. Now I want you to write all the comments in the SIGMA batch. If everyone is enjoying the course, then write in the SIGMA batch. And see that in the comment section. If you have any questions about the batch, then write in the SIGMA course. And it will be fun. Now, many people wanted to comment on the previous video. So, how to make this mouse wheel. So, you have to go to the settings. You have to write the mouse wheel. And here you can check the editor mouse wheel zoom. Then you press the control button. I have turned on the mouse wheel. I will do it like a mouse wheel. I will zoom in. And if I press the right button, then I can toggle screen cast mode. So, whatever I will show you, I will get you to see. I have not done the screen cast mode in this video. Because I already know what type I am typing. So, I can toggle screen cast mode. So, I can turn it on. So, you can see all the things I am doing. In the previous video, we have done the websites. We have talked about this. And the thing we did, you all understood a lot. Now, I will take an example of iPhone 15 pro max. And I will show you an order. How will it be a client server interaction. When a user is an iPhone. So, you will find it interesting. I will show you. So, guys, how do you do the website? I have explained Apple.com. Now, Apple.com is the same website. So, from their server, the data is here. All the HTML files are here. I will click on pre-order. And then, I will simply record. I am not coming. I will say, I will come in September. I will select 15 pro max. I will take some black and white items. What is going on? I will take 2 Webdgv, no trading, no Apple coverage. After that, you can see here. They have done the server communication. Let's go. So, we have all the things. The HTML CSS JavaScript. You can see. I have shown it to you. So, this is how I can show it. And this is our original website. I was working on it. Now, I will check it quickly. I will guest you. I will show you an interesting thing. I will click on the internet. You will see two and a half communication. With Apple's servers. Which means, I am going to action here. I am going to action here. I am going to action here. I am taking action server. And I am sending data. I would like to be delivered. I will add a name. I will deliver it in October. I will tell you in the update. Yes, everything is fine. I am doing the same. I am doing place your order. I have done place your order. I will like the video. I will also order iPhones for you to go to the development of the app. I will confirm this with OTP. OTP and my purchase. It is done. I have requested for some requests from Apple.com. I gave an iPhone 15 Pro Max. It is available in the Appal.com. So, the communication between the server and the client. This is through JavaScript. We will download the page without it. You will see. We have clicked on iPhone. All the things are from the JavaScript.
