forms of this video and what is the input tag form? It is very important to use the form in the form because you submit data through the form You can see the form on Google and Qwari forms You can see the data and the form on the flight ticket You can submit it through HTML and the form Last video I liked it a lot I will request you to like this video with high energy So that you can maintain the high energy throughout the course So let's go to the computer screen and see the forms of this video and see the best practices of this video Let's roll the intro So guys, I have already uploaded my computer screen Now I will make a folder that I will use in my video I will use the video to write down the name of this folder I will tell you all about this And you can also make the index.html and put the marks on it I will do the view, wrap, screen, mode and see the forms Let's learn it So I have set the title here For this form page And what is the work of setting the title in the actual page I want to tell you about a very important setting You have already made a comment about this You have to click it twice You can do something Yes you can do it Click on the gear Click on settings And after clicking on settings You simply click on the live preview Live preview And we can set it When we click on the actual page Then what is the external browser Now I will turn everything on As soon as I click here I will click on the external browser And the signal web development code The playlist of the code is on the right Click on the star And on the bookmark But now I will tell you As soon as I click here You can see So now you want to do it But sometimes you want to prefer side by side And when you want to use it In the actual HTML, CSS, CSS, and then you are working on the design So whenever you are working on the design You will definitely want You can see the live preview Here, which is why this extension was made And this live is different from the live version That's why you can see it on the side Now what will we do here We will go to the forms What is the form? No, you know the form It means it is a real form Because it gets reserved We get the form of IDJ And the form of the need We get an exam form So that our data can reach Until we want it So this is the form The HTML form tag Like you will write the form Enter This way You have already asked the first question What is the action of your form? Get your post Get request of post requests I will tell you a very quick difference We will come and see this thing When we will be working on the back end Get request is very simple request And post requests Now we will send these most of the cases When we have a lot of data If we post them So we will use post requests in most of the cases And what is the get request of this? It is very simple request We have to tell the server And that's it We have to hit the server From request Starts it But if you don't understand That should be fine It is not a problem Because we will come to do it in detail So the form action is equal to post Now I can show you some input tags What are the input tags you will tell people? What are your elements in your form? Like you can add date You can add form in it You can tell the name You can say phone number You can say this Your age is only number You can add form in this way I want to tell you That you can add input tags in the form And a label tag Which is used to label the input So what I will show you The simplest input tag is Type is equal to text So I will put the text in the input And you can see If you zoom out So you can see the input text And the user name And the user name And the user name And the action will be given in this way So you can say enter your user name And the user name You will have to enter the user name I will write a text And I will write it Malo form to apply For TAA For Sigma Web Dev TAA Sigma Web Development Codes TAA Malo we are teaching assistants For Sigma Web Development Codes So we can write something like this And I will show you And I will show you And I will show you This is a subtitle And I will write it in the form And I will write it in the form Malo is a young girl And she is looking at this And she is looking at this And she is looking at this And you can see That I have applied this And I will add this And the user name And I will use this label And the label is for And I will write it in the form Malo I will write it in the form And I will add it in the form And I will add it in the form And what is the ID? I will tell you And you can understand That this is unique identity And you can identify And you can identify That is the ID And you can get this ID And you can also get this name And I will write And you can see That the label is supported And also I will write in CSS And here I have also And you can select this label And you can make this label And this is for the iG And we need to fill this picture You can enter your gender and what you can ask from the email or email. What happens here? We wrap it in Dev. Dev is our block element. What are the block elements in this? I haven't told you in this course yet but I will tell you in the coming videos. So now I am going to put it in Dev. I will put it in Dev and it will be in New Space. It also has a VR tag. It also has a VR tag which is called Line Break. But I don't prefer VR tag and you will get to know why we don't want to upload our HTML to BLOAT. You will know in the coming videos. Now you can see the user name, email, and what is the female. As I am taking the female, this is the radio button. I am taking the male. Why is it so? Because the label is for this. I have put the power as equal to female and the ID is female. You see, you see, I have put the name of both of them. So the name is equal to gender. I have put the input tag as well. And the name is equal to gender is the input radio tag. And as we have written the type is equal to radio. And if the name is the same, then both of them can be selected only one at a time. If I select it, it will be only one. Now I will show you something. If I add the ID in the form of the label, and I don't add the ID in the first one. I will add the other one. So when I select the female, I don't select it. I am selecting the male. So I will have to click here to select the female. You see, I should always do the same. I always add the ID in the form of the label. You can see, I have added the label for the female. And we have a input tag, which is the type is equal to checkbox. If I add the type is equal to checkbox, I will add the ID in the form of the label. I will do the form of the label as I do. I will show you the form of the label. Now you can see, I will check the name in the form of the label. And the radio button and checkbox can be different. You can check the checkbox. If you want to see the female or the female, you can select it from the option. Now you have a text area, and it is select tag. And I will show you the text area. I will show you the text area. I will show you the text area. Text area is equal to the type is equal to text. But it has a rows and column attribute. You can choose the size of the text. Now you can see, the placeholder I have given you is the interior comment. The interior comment is the text in the interior. We will do it carefully. Or we will not give it a new line. I will show you the interior comment. And you can see the left side. You can see the interior comment. You can see the user comment. Now you can see, the text area is the content of the interior. You don't want to do the interior comment. You want to keep the text area empty. You can use a label as you like. For this is equal to comment. We will definitely add the ID. When we add the code, it is the ID for the element. Now you can see the interior comment. What will happen? I will write the interior comment. The interior comment will be here. You can see, the style is not that good. We will style it with CSS. Now I will write the B.R.Tag. But I don't recommend B.R.Tag. I will not recommend B.R.Tag. Because B.R.Tag is a bit thick. You should know that B.R.Tag is a line break tag. You should know that B.R.Tag is a bit thick. But I will tell you that B.R.Tag is something that I don't recommend. I don't recommend using it all the time. I will add the new spaces. I will copy it. I will copy it. I will show you the select tag. You can see that I will add the select tag. I will add the div tag. You can get options like select, syntax, apple, cherry. You can use one from cherry. You can see that I have added a value to apple. I have added a name to fruit. Option value is equal to apple. Option value is equal to apple. When we will parse this form, I will tell you the JavaScript partner. We have to send this data to server. I will tell you the steps. Stay tuned for that. I had told you all the elements of the form in this video. You can select all the things in this video. I have told you about the action of other attributes. You can submit a page on any of the attributes. You can give the form a form. The method is that get request or post request. I will tell you the difference between these two. I have told you that get request is very simple. Post request is used when you have to send a big data. You can send a lot of data in post request. We will send passwords in get request. We will send it with post request. I have told you the method in name. What is the name? The user doesn't mean we mark it. If we mark it with name, we will know the server. What is the corresponding value? The name and value of the server will be the same. We will see the server processing. What is the placeholder? What will be written in it? Enter your user name. I will click enter user. It is written in it. I will also write something. Enter user name is just telling me. I have to add user name. After that, you have to require it. You have to add value. We will use it a lot. Then we have autofocus. What is autofocus? Autofocus is automatically focused. I will show you the focus. If you write it in the tag, then you will be focused. Enter your user name. I will reload it. If I type it, then it will focus on it automatically. Autofocus is the type you will type. I hope you are understanding. You can give a patent to the user. You can give a regular expression pattern. You can give a regular expression pattern. You can give a particular pattern. You can give a particular pattern. If you put a pattern in it, then you can't put it in it. You should know this. I hope you are enjoying this video. And with this, I would definitely give a comment section. Let me know in the comments section. And before the video, please review this course. Many people ask me, I should not do this course. If it is free course, then people do not value it. If it is free, then we will watch it. And we will give a note to those people who have told me what to do for the paid course. They will pay us and join the sigma batch. And you can join the sigma batch. Cut your losses and join the sigma batch. Because, look, what quality of this course is. I don't think you need to tell me. So, you guys, do this. You guys will get everything. I am telling you. I mean, this is the course that I will sell in Rs.10,000. This is the start of the amount that we fixed. I will sell in Rs.10,000. And I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course. If there is nothing wrong in selling any course. But the thing is, if you have bought any other course, and you still feel that you have made sigma a big course. So, you should join. Cut your losses and join. Because if you make your career, then in the future, you will not get anything. If you guys come back in time, and watch the movie, then you guys will also say, yes, we have got a paid course. Then, we got a pre-course, which we understood. And if you guys have become a career, then these things will not matter. So, do what is right for you. And you understand your own thing.
