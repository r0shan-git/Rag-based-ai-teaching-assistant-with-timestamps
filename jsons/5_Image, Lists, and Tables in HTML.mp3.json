Bye."}], "text": " In this video, we will see how images are made in HTML and table. So, if you like the video, I know a lot of people like YouTube videos. But if you do, thanks to the support of you all, I get the motivation to bring free courses like this. So, let's start the 5th video of SIGMA Webloff Lab and the 5th video. Let's roll the intro. So, guys, I have already seen the video in the computer screen. First of all, I want you to know that you can buy the GETUP.COM slash code in Dharik. So that you can get all the code. Second, you can click on the playlist and click on the star. And then you can save it. Now, I will tell you the first thing about the image. In HTML, what is the image? So, what we will do here will be a folder. New folder of video 5, you can come here and click on the SHIFT RIDE. Open with code is very expensive. I will tell you later. But if you want to see the new folder, you can click on the new folder. So, click on the new folder. And then click on the show welcome page and startup. And you can click on the new folder. But what we are doing is, we will make the HTML and the controls of the index. We will zoom in and do the screen and do the screen and the support of the screen. So that you will know what kind of buttons I am in and why I am in the next one. Now, I will take the exclamation mark and take the image abbreviation. And here I will do the view and draft. I will have to work hard here. You can see here that your board draft has been turned off. So, here you will not be able to do the horizontal scroll. Now, what I will do here is, I will write images. First, I will write images. And I will simply do what I will do here. I will take an image. Now, I can bring the image from the internet. I will write here. Let us take an image and come to train. Okay, train images. Because we have run a lot of trains in this course. So, we will write the images of the train. We will write some images. I will do the same image. And here, I will do the same image of the sigma web development course in the video number 5 folder. This is a CMS file. In fact, I will do a work in this case. I will do a cancel. I will take a snap. Because I am going to go to the PNG and choose it. So, I have shot the windows, shift and S-divaya. I have shot the sleeping tool and you do not know. Now, you will know the sigma web development course. You will know that if you will go to windows, shift and S-divaya, then your sleeping tool will be opened in windows. Do not know about this. In the comment section, you will know the image from the Imam Daddy. Now, what will we do here? I have done the windows shift S. I have started talking. So, click here and save it. This floppy disk option is saved here. Now, click here. And go to the downloads. Go to sigma web development course. Go to the video 5Mit. Image. Okay, image saved. Now, it is an IMG tag in HTML. Now, the IMG, like you will put, All the S-rc and all the attributes required are required. In fact, if you do not write all the attributes, then it will be recommended. I will tell you what are the attributes. First of all, if you click in S-rc, you can see the image.png. You can see the image here. I will put the image. I will put the image in the old. Now, if you have seen the image, then you will preview it. See, this is the page of our image. What is the point of writing all the attributes? You can say, I will tell you where the all the attributes are. You can see, the things that are in the old, I have not seen that. Manlo, for some reason, you cannot see the image. Okay? What will happen? I have written the image too. Now, image2.png, your file is not here. So, what will happen? What will happen? What will happen? So, the all the attributes will be displayed. And this way, the error image will be displayed. Which will tell you that you have put the image. It is written from the right. You have given it something. Here, the image of the server that you have given, is not here. Okay, this way, it is shown like this. And it shows the all the attributes there. And the difference is that, what is the difference between the image and the all the attributes. And if I come back here, you can write all the attributes here. I will not write all the attributes here. I will not write all the attributes here. I will not write all the attributes here. So, you will not want that when your server is in error, you will see the image. From this way, the scenario is made. You can see the user's image from this way. The train has written this way. Okay? I hope you understood. Image1 is straightforward. There are two more attributes that are very important. So, it is a bit. It is written in pixels. If I write 23, then you can see it. In fact, I will correct the image. I have written the image too. I have written the image too. Image.png. So, here you can see it. I have written 23 pixels. Because it is very small. So, I will write 23 pixels. I will write it in this. You do not need to write it in Px. You can write in CS. When we write the weight, we will see that we need to write Px. Here, only if we write the weight, then we write double quotes. Like you can see it. Okay? So, if I take it here, then you can see that, this small image is written in the weight. If I give it a height, I will give it a height. But if it has is almost with this height, then its aspect ratio will definitely be around 186 sphere. So, it will be a bit stretch. Because it is without any weight, it also has a subtachio, had a height as well as a\u4f60\u8981 daily. So, you can also see with this height. If you want to go view that if you want,iatage or weight means avoid that is working. It is just to use it. Now if you want to increase weight, then you can just use simply high knit attribute. Let us increase the height of the height of the fitment which will help begin and just adjust the height of the fully applied fabric. So that is how overall, high added slightly bigger these, Sauce is increasing, a bit wider than sist. We will see in the CSS section why we always have to set the grid in this way. We always have to set one thing from the grid to the grid. When our page is loading, then the image of the page is coming from the grid. I will tell you in the coming videos. But now you understand that these grid and the grid are attributes. Many people don't say that they are deprecated or used. But I would say that they should be used for purpose. I will tell you in the coming videos where I will tell you about core, vital and SEO. Now you will see that the image of the grid is going to be hit. The second one is automatically set to the second one. And these values are in pixels and you don't have to write px or pixel. You have to write this number and that's it. This is an attribute, height and an SRC attribute. You can use style attribute. In fact, style attribute is almost used with all the tags. Now we will talk about the tables. The table tag is very useful in HTML. What is table tags? I will tell you. You will get a table tag. I can copy the table here. Then when I copy the table, you can see the page that I have shown in this way. So, this is the table of HTML. My previous page is here. Here, name, name and name is Harry H. If I will add more things here. I will add some new names here I will add designation, I will add designation, I want to add more I will use all ship bottom I will use all ship bottom I will write I want to write favorite language I want to write here JavaScript Now you will see Name, destination, favorite language I will show you how to use table tag Table tag is called T-R tag What will come in this row? You will see If you want to use table heading You will see table row This row is Name, destination, favorite language What will come in this row? What will come? You will see that it will be a heading So I will use T-H We will write table heading T-R will write T-H We will add table heading Then we will add data We will add table row T-D will stand table data And here you will add rows What will come in this row? You will see that I will write here And this is also a programmer And this is the favorite language You will see that it will be a heading You will see that it will be a heading We will see that it will be a heading You can style it But this is given by default And we will see that But you can see that table is working In this way Now we will add rowspan and callspan attributes Now you will see that it will be a heading How much rows will span your T-D For example Let us write I want to write a program I wanted to write a program I wanted to write a program I didn't write the program in 2 cells I wanted to write a program in 4 cells And I want to write Call span is equal to 2 Call span is equal to 2 You will see that Sam will take 2 columns What does it mean? Sam will take 2 columns You can see the Sam in this way You can see the Sam in this way So this is the whole column The column span will be a column of the column So the height will be a column of the column but sometimes it will be a cell, it will be a column. To demonstrate this, you can explain to the people of Excel. In Excel, you will understand that it is a table mrhtml. Sometimes I want to expand this column one by one data. So here we use merge cell. And here I write Sam. This is used in HTML. Sometimes we want to merge vertically. I mean, I want to merge these two cells. Here we use rosepan. And whose use rosepan we will use? We will use rosepan. Td is obviously. We are using call span. We are using rosepan. So this will span two rows. I hope you guys understood. When we will make tables, we will make HTML. Then you will understand better. But I will show you how to use rosepan. If I write rosepan as well as two rows. And then I will write one more TR here. So you will see that this is my table. Now I will explain this to you. I will add CSS style here. I will add a style sheet. And I will keep the style sheet. So in style.css, You guys can understand CSS. I will tell you already. I will write in td. 2 pixel solid black. And you guys will know how to do it. But now you understand that I have added this. To explain. So I said that this is the necessary parameter of this. So I said that Sam is the rosepan. I have added a row of rows. I said that my Java is the rosepan. So how much Java will take? Obviously it will take two rows. So here we will take two rows. You can see that Java has taken two rows. So when Java has taken two rows, I don't want to go to the next one. Because it has already been built. So I will not write Java here. I have taken this call span. So what can we do with this? This was a hack. Then I said that Sam is the two columns that we will take. This one will take two columns. And Java will take two rows. You can see that the exact same voice here. It took two rows. So this is how we can use the cross span of the column. In HTML. In HTML table, we can add captions. And to add captions, we can use captions like this. So I will show you. If we will use captions, student details. So you can see the page in this way. You can see that the captions in the template will be added here. Now CSS change is also possible. It has a font size. But now we can see the caption in this way. The caption is added here. You can also add header and footer. You can also add T-Head or T-Foot. If I add T-Head or T-Foot in content, I will add header and footer in here. So you can see the T-Head or T-Foot. You can see the header and footer. Now I will show you a more tech. I will add a B-H-TAC line break. You can see the line break. So this header is there. And after that, I will add footer. I will not add here. All the tables I will add are at the end. So this is my table footer. Now I can change CSS. Now I can group the content of header and footer from T-Head or T-Foot. We can see the header and footer I will add TR to the body. I will do it right click and document it. It will be better format. I want to add TR to the body. I want to group it in T-foot. So this is how it will be grouped. I added T-foot in T-foot. I added T-body in T-body. I added T-head in T-head. I added T-head in T-head. I have not come to change anything. I have grouped it. I will do my work here. I will write a footer here. I can see that the last one is the footer. I am using the footer. I have grouped it. I have targeted it. You will use it very less. You can do it like this. You can use the footer. You can use the footer. You can use the footer. You can write it like this. You can write it like this. You can write it like this. I hope you understood. That is all about HTML tables. Don't want to have too many people. Now we will talk about this list. List is of \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e compelling HTML tables. List of lot scales. 3\u6708lis there is HTML template. Estab erosion line. Estab erosion line. I love them. I like them just like .. I have unaware of these. I keep them here . We will write them here like see some useful asides. I can write this in the file. I can write Harry. And I can write Rohan. And I can write Shubham. When I write Harry-Rohan Shubham, I will write this as an ordered list. Harry-Rohan Shubham is here. They have an order. 12345 is not in this. But if I want this order, I can write this as an order. If I want to make this opening closing tag as an order list, I can write this as an order list. 12345 will be in this. You can do the PVCB, capital AVCB, Roman numbers, CSS, and so on. You can see the similar in the image of the UL. You can see this as an order list. Here, this is the order list. This is the definition list. This is the definition list. It is used in many ways. You have already written the first heading. And then you have written the DL. DL means definition list. DT means DD. So here definition term is term. It is definition of definition. So this is something like this. And you can change it in CSS. It is very less used. But you should know about this. For interviews. And ask if there is a definition list. So this is what the code is used for. I am also writing this. And here first we will see the An order list. An order list is very simple and straightforward. You can customize the bullet points and use type attribute. If I am going to do type is equal to square. I am going to do type is equal to and I am going to do square. So I have written the type is equal to square. This is how the square is used. Similarly, I can circle the type in the UL. I can do this by default. I can do this by default. I can do this by circle. I can do this by circle. Similarly, you can add more list items in the list of this. Now let's see the order list. If you write the order list in the order list, this will be 1,2,3. But you can use type is equal to i. If you are going to use type is equal to i, then you will get the case of Roman numbers. If you are going to do small i, then you will get the lower case of Roman numbers. Type is equal to 1, which is default. You will get the small i, then you will get the alpha. And you will get the capital. You will get the case of alpha. Let's see the type is equal to. I will get capital. We have given examples of VS code. We are going to see the possible values. This is the value of VS code. And many people are using old editors. They used it a lot. If you know the correct plug-ins, then you will get a lot of set. So, let's switch to VS code. You will use all the VS codes. You will get the use of VS code. If you want to do in mobile, then comment in the reply. And you will get a shout out of the reply. Because I use it a lot. I like it a lot. You can use it in your mobile. If you don't have computer power and computer, then you will get templates. You will get more cover in the video. But I will stick to VS code. I hope you have understood the order list. An order list is definitely list. If you have completed 5 videos, I want to go to the first video and write a comment. How do you like the code? I have started with 5 stars. What is the initial review of this code? I know that the order is delayed. But the data is delayed. I know that people do not do comments on YouTube. But I want to comment on the comments. I will tell you how to go to the first video. And write in the comment box. I get a lot of motivation. I will comment on the second video. If you want to comment on the second video, I will tell you a lot of things. I will give you the link in the description. I will give you the playlist. Like the video. Write in the comment box. And I will give you the link in the comment box. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."}
