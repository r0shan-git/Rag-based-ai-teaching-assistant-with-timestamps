    "text": " Today we will start the SIGMA web development course with this video We will start with this video with this high energy Because in this video, I will be making a profitable web developer with zero This course is a modern world because web development has changed over time There are many new things There are many things in JavaScript that are very easy to work with There are many technologies that will make you work very hard These course will be for those people who don't know anything You know zero once about web development course We will start with zero but we will continue to raise the bar What we will learn is that in this course, I will tell you in a few days Web development is a very profitable thing I have made a lot of money through web development And my main thing is that you can learn a lot of web development Like course, you will learn notes, cheats, cheats, references This course will be a little different Because I will learn all the technologies that I have experienced in this course And I will make a complete course with all the web development technologies The course content will be complete web development, front and back and database Which you should learn as much as possible I will tell you in a few days what will be the course content But you will be able to keep trust that you will be a full stack developer You will be able to do a lot of projects In the course of the course and in the end, some good projects will be made So that you can get a lot of strong ones on web development I have learned the best way to learn project based learning So I will make a lot of projects and if you agree, then write in the comment section Because when you comment, it gets spied on my face So comment, I want to give you a lot of advice To finish this course, you will get an end to the start of the website And in this course, I will also make a lot of websites like you Your confidence will go up So let's start with the first video of your development course with your sigma web development course Let's roll the intro Alright guys, I have already in my computer screen And as I am doing like this, you guys follow me I have downloaded Google Chrome browser and you also download Google Chrome browser I am not doing this, but you guys have to do exactly the same thing as the beginner who is doing this So here we will follow a gum like I am doing And with that, you will get exactly the same videos as you will follow I will go to Google quickly and I will write download VS code What is this VS code? It is a source code editor If you click on Windows, you will get Windows If you are in Mac, Linux, or any other operating system You can download VS code for that feature operating system And you can see exactly the same process That my download folder is in here Here is the VS code And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded I will refresh you And here you can see the VS code setup You can install it So simply install VS code Install the game as easy as possible You can easily use this slide and up slide And then I will accept the agreement I will accept it And I am the fastest reader in the world I will do it Next, next Check both icons Check both icons Check the settings If you want to get a shortcut, then you can get a shortcut And then you can get a shortcut And then install it If your PC is fast, then it will be fast But if you are a PC, then it is slow So there is no problem with the shortcut So it will be slow, and there is nothing more Now I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel Because these videos, I want to download the video as you follow So if you want to follow this course, then you should subscribe With that said, our VS code is downloaded I have opened my VS code Don't be scared, don't be scared And I am telling you again If you are already coming Beginner is taking the start of the video But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming video So stay tuned I will request you to tell me in the comment section Your level, beginner, advanced, intermediate users Tell me in the comment section where you can get a web development Beginner, advanced, intermediate Please comment Now what is the VS code here? I have downloaded it as a Q I think it is So if you don't know the beginner, let me tell you The VS code is a code editor Which helps you edit the code Now you can also edit the code in the node pad So yes, in the kernel node pad, it will also be in that Yes, I am not doing it in the casteically Or I will setup it here And I will show you what it is Which makes it a little different from the node pad Now let's setup it quickly I will not do it without the color themes In fact, I will do it I will put dark mode on the theme Next section, next section You can also turn this welcome to the next section But there are some tips you are telling That's it The VS code here is already started You can see the screen of this VS code You can make new files, new folders But I will recommend you to turn it off Yes, you can turn it off I am going to make a new folder And I am going to keep it in the name of the folder You guessed it right Now let's do the course We will do everything in this course We will do everything We will do everything We will do it later If you will do the shift in the windows You can see that the option of open with code is now This option of open with code is You can open this particular folder In the VS code You can select it What will you do here? You can choose this file and then select this You can switch it off And this folder is open Now I will click on plus To make a new file I have written there the index.html Write it down And then I will show you This is the first html file I have written it Here you can see the windows white This is the window You can save the file You can save it You can save it If you want to use control S, then you can disable this option. Test\u0442\u044c and see how to use manual settings. And the font size of your phone is changed. Now I will show you a magic. It is very simple logic. What happened in the name of the web development course in the name of the web development course? This file is made in the index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. I will make this. This folder is also made here. This folder is also made here. And these two are going in sync. Open this file from here and open the node pad. And I will show you this node pad. Open this file. So I can do that too. But I will not use the node pad. Because in VS code, there are some such things that do not give me the node pad. And I want to get the features. I don't want to overrun you guys. But I will show you the result of the result. What is the result of the node pad? If I write here, I will enter the HTML. This automatically gave me the opening closing tag. If I mark the exclamation mark here, I will click on the HTML that I will give you. And I will click on the HTML basic code. And I will start again. You guys should not overrun it. But I want to tell you that This is the way we have created the VS code. We have used the node pad. And this is how big the file is. It is developing. It is necessary to make the file feel. So it will come to the confidence to coding. I want to comment on Mac and Linux users. I want to use exactly similar things. I am using Windows. I have Windows Laptop. Linux Mac and Windows 3 are not used together. So you will be able to do exactly the same thing. In fact, I want to say that it is similar. It is exactly the same. It is very similar. So you guys will be able to follow along. So don't be too tensed. I will tell you about some extensions. You will be able to enjoy it. You will be able to use those extensions. You will be able to enjoy it. I will also tell you about some extensions. And this is criminally underrated. I will tell you that it will be fun. I want to tell you that You will write the command and the command. So we will get a lot of options of the VS code. You will get all the options. We will get all the options. The feature that comes in the user. I will tell you guys about it. And you guys will be able to use it. But what I will do now is I will toggle a screen cast mode. I will not do this. But I will do it. I will click it. I will type something. I will click the caps lock. I will tell you about the concept button. I will not recommend this thing to you. But I want to tell you that I will show you the screen cast mode. I will change the settings from here. Now you can see the screen cast mode's vertical offset. What is the vertical offset? If I want vertical offset to be zero, I will go up. If I want vertical offset to be zero, I will do 60. If I want 60, I will do 80. From bottom to top. I have zeroed. Now I will type something. I will show you the bottom. Which is ideal. I will do this. I will close the text file. I will close the settings tab. For tabs, you can use Chrome tabs. I hope you have understood what is going on. I will tell you about the setup. What is the exact thing? You can also close the page. If you are zooming in the VSCode, I will record the video. You can see the PAD plus. I have zoomed in the top. I am doing zooming because I record videos. I want you to see the screen from the past. But when I am coding on my own, I do not zoom in. This is what you have to be careful about. VSCode has related things. I want to tell you how the websites work. Basically, 3 people work for the people. 1. client, Who is the client? Who is the server? Who is the browser? Who is the person who is the father? So what is the server? I am the client who is the browser. Who is the browser? I am the client. I am the code with Harry.com. So what do I say? I am the user. I am the user. I am the user. I am the user. I am the user. So I will enter the server. So I will enter the server. I have already shown this screen. This is so fast. My internet is fast. But still my locality is very fast. So this fast internet speed is very fast. So the client is the server. The browser is the client. I will help the server. Who is the server? I am the user. I have been given the code of this server. I have written this code when I am writing YouTube. I have converted this code into a browser. The client is the browser. It is called a browser. I ask for it. I give it to you. This server will give it to you. You might as well give it as the user. Your answer would cost 200k Greer. And that is our browser. You might want to earn it before rapidly emailing your online blog. This is the result of the browser client. Let me tell you one more thing. When you write google.com, you can call me google.com. It is called browser. Google.com is a server. It is called browser. Google.com is given to you. Google.com is a server with all the images and videos. All the images are sent to you. This is the URL of these icons. It is also called browser. It is displayed in a size. The server is sent to a bundle. It is sent to a bundle. It is called browser. The user will interact with this page with the browser. I will go to network after inspecting and inspecting. It has shown the send brings something to you. The number of boxes is not changed yet. Then the browser is given. You can find this donation in a random host and pick out an order updates from you. Theher write send\u30c4 once again. So, the server is sent from coordinator's location. So what did this waiter do? He saw that waiter and you are back Order can be done in order It is very less than that You are ordering something and you can't get it But sometimes it happens here Sometimes you get error 4.04 error or 500 error It is not working properly So whenever you get the error You are told that But ideally 200 is the right response And you get the same error So you can get a restaurant Whenever you write google.com slash mail If you write google.com slash mail And if you write code with any contact with any contact Then you will see the phone number Or the phone number Or 500 error Whatever server you send This cycle is running Client request, browser And then server And then process request After that server sent the server back And whatever server you send Then the client showed the browser Then the client did something Then the server sent the server And then the server sent the server And then the client got the browser And so on So now you all are fine But what is the background? The background is that how the server is processing the request If you have a blog There is a lot of data in the blog So what you will do You will store all the web pages in the blog Or you will generate the content dynamically You will generate the content dynamically You will generate the content dynamically I will take a example of google If I search here You can see the header of google This is the link This format doesn't change If I write here I have written the script Then I will write like the script Now see When I wrote the script What is the google that is serving the server? The backend The backend process It is sent to the HTML corresponding to the command So when you write the script When you write the header Then it is sent So to generate this The process of creating a system This is the backend Now this backend can be jangled This can be flashed This can be node j as This backend can be run through Ruby on Rails And the database used in the backend It is used to see the client who is the backend code It is not seen as the client is the client This is the client's code And how did the server make this code? We don't know If you are confused, you can also be confused You will understand everything We will come and see the backend Now we understand how to work in the frontend The frontend It is made from 3 languages HTML, CSS And JavaScript These are 3 languages If you are making a website Every website has HTML, CSS, and JavaScript In most of the cases If you only use HTML Then it is very basic The skeleton is the website And CSS when you use it You can style it So it is only seen as CSS Along with that This button is red This is the size of CSS You can see the edges of CSS This is the size of CSS So CSS is the work of style How to style the page What color of this button is it What will be the whole thing It is a beauty HTML HTML is the real body Some people understand This is a standard If you make any website Then it is made in HTML So that the browser is understood It is a part of HTML And HTML is a skeleton It is a standard Any website will make it in HTML It will make a skeleton It is a standard So that every page Is made in the same way And if someone is making a browser Then you have to parse the same language If you learn HTML Then you are good to go for web development HTML is directly something Like if I write a HTML code This is how HTML code is written I am writing HTML code I am using XML I have used it You have to pay attention to it From the code I will write this is HTML And I can open this HTML file And as soon as I open this HTML file I will open it You can see this I can open it I have double-click this Now you can see this is HTML But this is not style-dual The HTML file is very basic. You can run directly videos from HTML file. I have HTML file that I will show you. I work on the HTML file and I will show you the video. In the HTML file, you will get a video tag. You will get a video tag. You will get a video tag in the SRC. I will show you the video 1.10. You can see the video file on the VSCode. You can use the VSCode file. You can see that I will reload it. I will play it automatically. I will play it automatically. I will have to click on the control button. I will refresh it. I will play it. I will play it. The advantage of this file is that it needs a lot of people to get it. I will have to cache it. I will have to cache it. I will have to cache it. I will have to cache it. I have done one video and I did one other video. There are two more videos on the remains. Today I will have to follow the video I've published. After this, I will refer them to while continuing with the video title. Whether I press 2.10 before I add that time video I will also be uploading the video and do a re-load. I will be talking about the cooling. And I will watch the integration video animation. I' ll put the daughters on the camera later. I will download the third video and play it I have released the third video I have released the video 3.MP4 I will also close it and can also run the video 4 And the video 4 is a DJ video I have DJ I will play it I will play it I will play it You can make this kind of thing You don't need to do anything else You can play videos, play images You can only do it If you want to style it I want to add a border You can add a red background You will have to use CSS You can add CSS to any website Then you can add a interaction For example, when I will click on search When I will write code with Harry I will write code with Harry I will write code with Harry I will write auto complete Why did I come here? Because I have requested it on the server And auto complete results are here This is all the things We call it client side script We want to do script in client We want to do coding We can do it on client side This is the brain So we have to do it on our website I am talking about beauty with brain With brain And brain from JavaScript Now JavaScript helps you to make a dynamic page If you want to change content Then it is all the things from JavaScript If you want to come here I will kill these people I am not able to help them I am working on my record Oh my god I will like the video because I will eat croc When I was in college I had a chumkha I went to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and CK I was learning it before I learnt it before I don't remember everything But this brain is wrong Because HTML is only 80% And CSS is only 40% And JavaScript is only 50% to 70% We can start web development We can make projects We can make them So in this course I will tell you about chat GPD and web development What I am back to chat GPD So we will do it You guys should be tuned So don't forget to click the CSS I will do it for a year I will do it for a year I will do it for a year I will make projects in 4 years Think about it HTML, C, CSS, and CK And JavaScript is only 50% to 70% You can make a big website And as soon as you make a website You will experience more HTML and CSS And you will learn more about JavaScript And you will also learn how to make HTML and CSS You will be able to make a lot of money And as a professional web developer You guys will be learning And you will be able to make your skills So now I will think about all HTML attacks And you will be able to make all the CSS properties And you will be able to make all the JavaScript I will teach you so much I will only teach you that You will learn what matters And I don't want you to learn only for years So I designed this course with this course So that you will learn only those things Which matter And the other thing is You will learn many things And I will teach you in many different courses Here, SIGMA web development course has been taught by students Which is good for our audience In this course, we will learn HTML and CSS And I will teach you in this course Which you will not hear And I will teach you in this course And I will teach you in this course And I will teach you in this course I have learned a lot of great tricks In my career, I learn a lot of things And I want you to learn all the tricks If you are in a doubt test course In these videos, you can use the hashtag And use the hashtag And ask your doubts I am going to try to answer all the doubts I will try my best And I will try to solve all the doubts So if you have any questions, Please write a hashtag down And please, Write in the comments And don't write them down So that I can do the comments And do the hashtags down I will try to answer all the doubts As much as I can And you will not get everything in this course So if you have not done this course Then that will bring a smile on my face So do do it What is this react? What is the next JS? So, see all these From the framework of the front end Or you will help in using JavaScript So, HTML and CSS are made from the JavaScript They help in making this process How? We will learn in this course I have told you that you will make a different course I will make you do this To make you a new course And to make you a new course You will be able to learn in web development And to get your own language Because you have taken a ticket And to give a good analogy And to teach JavaScript HTML is just like car skeleton And CSS is also painted And internal engine is painted So, JavaScript is painted And to see the example of a human, It is HTML And then, skin is painted And brain is painted And you have a nervous system And JavaScript Now, I will take you to Forbes.com And if you go to Forbes, You will see that you have opened a website And Forbes.com That website uses HTML and JavaScript Like a second website If I click on right And click on inspect And see that the inspect element is opened And you have used the head in the head And to add CSS And to add CSS You have used the link And I will do what I will do here And use CSS To do CSS, I will do what I will do And all the style tags And I will clear them And use the delete And then I will add all the style tags And then I will add all the links And then I will show you the details of all the styles And see what is the result of this page Like what I will show You will see that there are only fellow HTML And similarly, look at the script tag I deleted a blank page of HTML without the HTML script I want to tell you that this course was initially made to be paid I converted this to free course and I thought I will put it on YouTube and I want you all to be serious I have also reached out to the people who have paid course for this course. But I should have given a lot of companies. But I should have given a lot of companies for this course. Because when I learn web development, I can understand that when I don't have a course for learning and I don't have an affordability to do a paid course. So I can understand and I decided that I should have launched a Sigma web development course. I have absolutely free of course. This course is free but it is free. As you will earn money in the coming days. You will get a lot of opportunities to earn money in this video. So when you earn money in the coming days, you will get a lot of money in the coming days. But you have to do it when you earn good money. Only after you start earning good. So I will tell you in the next video how to earn money in this way. But I have to pay for this. This is also important. I'm freelancing with Pakistan now. How to act clients? I will tell you all about this course. I would like to tell you several action items. I want to give you a desk list where you can access the first action item. But I will let you view all of the bookmas, start button and call the list. Also, start button and typage that part so that you can be saved. Rest now you can discuss about this. Engineering paid course is at 1st, we will please you. Thank you so much for all your support. This code seems fresh to me but this code seems to be free Now technical issues don't need to be disclosed I'm in 1080p and supplement the design This Cube should be so clearly But the desired size is either S,D but suggestions for video\u602a the Jio River stability but initially this was\u66f4 stubborn and speaking of any bogging bird Someone called Nagar Pali. So I hope you guys understand this video, what is the response, how all these websites work. A basic idea we got is how client server interaction is. In coming videos we will see how the website is made. We will make our first website in the next video. So a lot of people will need to be excited. In the next video, our first website is going to be. And you can say that it is the first website. So, please access it. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time."
