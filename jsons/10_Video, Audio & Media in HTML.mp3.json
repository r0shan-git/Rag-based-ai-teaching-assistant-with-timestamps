in our very first video that we can embed videos inside the HTML Today I will tell you how to auto play KSTML How to use mutated video and how to enable and disable the control of the video Along with that, we will also see about the audio closely How to show the video in the video Like this video and subscribe to our channel And also like this video and subscribe to our channel Because I have used examples of video tags for video tags So let's go to video screen and let's roll the intro Friends, I have made a video called Folder And I will not waste time with the open with code of shift right click In fact, I will make an index-trim And today's video is video How to play video How to play video How to play video in HTML file How to play video in audio How to play video in media So, to add video, one step forward I will copy it Which is our video tag It has a KSRC attribute And some other attributes Which I will discuss in the video But first I will tell you That the video is also written here So if you have video mp4 You will have to play it So let's see I have put control here And I will preview it And you can see that this video is here Now it is a very big video So what can I do? I can say that I can say that this is called And I will do pixels And in fact, I need to click PX I will only do 555 I don't need to click PX And I don't need to click PX So, as soon as I do 555 I will do it in an impact I will do 555 So that it can be even smaller In fact, I will do it in 255 And you can see that I have come here And I will play it here I can play it here I have a good role in this video What is my name? What is your name? What is your name? What is your name? You can play it here Add some attributes You should have a video You can use it as a control You can download it You can use it as a control You can mute it You can do picture and picture This is automatically used for browser But I will tell you about some attributes You can find out And put the video file This file can be used as an external URL If I have uploaded some more videos on Amazon S3 I can add a URL here It is not necessary to use your computer You can also use your server What is your control? It is an ads video Because we have seen In the video You are seeing the controls What is this? It looks like a browser What will be your control? Then you will play the auto You can play the auto You can play auto You can play auto What is your control? What is your control? You can play auto I will play auto And the next attribute is loop I will play the loop I will show you You can play the loop You can play auto And I will play auto And I will play auto And I will play auto And the next attribute is mutate Mutate I will play auto And when I add videos I will add videos I will demonstrate something I will use mutate And when I record a video I will show you I will show you This is my element I will highlight this video I don't want audio I will mutate You can use mutate Postar I will have a image Download.jpg If I write here Postar is equal And I write down.jpg I will play this And I will play I will show you Postar Attributes You can use this You can specify the video's dimension I will show you You can specify the video's dimension I hope you understand I will explain Now I will show you audio This is my video's I will show you Some are required I will add some You can add some Let me forget I will show you This is also important Let's solve all the problems As you can see I will add my SRC I will add my SRC I will reload I will show you Now. I can play the audio in this video. What is the problem with the audio? I can't use the audio in this video. I can't use the audio in this video. I can't use the audio in this video. Now let's see the audio of the video. You can see the source video file. Now let's see the controls of the video. What will we play with the audio? I will play with the audio. What is the audio? What will we play with the audio? The next attribute is the loop. What will we do? I will loop the audio. What is the audio? What is the response? I have repeated it. I have looped the audio in this video. You have seen the audio. I have looped the audio in this video. I have looped the audio in this video. I have repeated it. The MP3 is played again and again. You can use the MP3 in this video. You can use the MP3 in this video. You can use the MP3 in this video. What will we play with the audio? You definitely don't want to play with the audio. But we will play with the audio. We will play with the audio. What is the difference between the audio and the audio? You can mute him with the audio of 5 or 6 videos. You can see the viewers by typing and using them. If you have control in your hand, Here we have a PRILOlt() Preload the audio at all. Preload means if you want to fetch the browser data, then you will use preload attribute. Otherwise you will not use preload attribute. Preload is equal to non default value. Preload is equal to meta data means that the browser is not only meta data, the audio file will be reloaded in the information about it. Because the first one will be reloaded. And what will be done by auto? The browser will be reloaded by the entire audio. So preload is equal to auto. So if I do this, it will be downloaded and automatically loaded. So that whenever the user plays it, the audio will be saved. So preload attribute is equal to auto. And it is very difficult to get the preload attribute. So you should know what is preload attribute. Before we start, I want you to share this playlist with your friends. I am seeing that the video is getting very detailed. We are going to start the video. I hope you like this video. And with that, just like you are doing this repository, you can also start it. Your star will help you a lot. I will get the preload. So this was about audio and video tags. I told you all the attributes. And you should definitely use it. I will give you all the measures. So that you can try out these things. Many people asked me, can we use the template? I have not used it in this course. But replete.com is an amazing website. If you want to use it in your phone, you can use it in your email. You can also use it in your email. You can also try it out for Android. They have not asked me anything. But I am also trying to use the most of the people who prefer to use it. So I have made videos in the VSCorn. But personally, I use replete. And also there are videos in the template. Next topic is SVG. It is related to media. SVG is a format. You can create a image. It is a very high graphics vector image. You can make it in this way. So SVG is used in the same way. It is used in the same way. I am using it in my IMG tag. If I add SVG here, then SVG will come here. So SVG and the circular SVG will come here. Video, audio, SVG are the online elements. So we are looking at it in the line. So people have seen it. Now what is here? You can save SVG file from different. You can save SVG file from different. So if I write here, I will save the IMG.SVG and SVG content. So if I write here, I will write this. And I will write this. So you guys, see here, I have not seen this. If I write here, I will write my SVG image. So you have to see, I have come here in SVG. But SVG is not able to see me. Why is it so? It is so. Because SVG is in SVG file in browser. And SVG file, you will see in the browser, you will see a declaration. I will show you. So I have written SVG file not showing. So here, the stack and the answer you will have to tell you. So you will have to write this. I will show you. You have to add something in XML. You have to add this. Name, space, declaration. So SVG, you will have to add something. And now you guys have seen SVG. So this is very important. And many people will make websites in future. So I will definitely write this problem. I will write it. So I am telling you. The problem you faced in the first story. You did not have a problem. I have also told you that it is going to be a solution. The next topic is the iframes. Iframes is very simple. You can embed a second website from iframes. I want to embed this in the iframe. I can use it from iframe. I will copy this URL. I will paste it here. And you guys see that the website is embedded. You will definitely want to embed it in iframe. But if you want to embed it in iframe. You can embed it in this way. I will add some height. So width is equal to width. I will add it to let it be 122. I will add it to let it be 144. Okay. Let me know. So this is something like this. So this is definitely the width. So this is what I have come in this line. But if I add a little bit of width. I will add a little bit of width. Okay. So this is the entire embed. You can see my website. You can embed a website. You can use it from iframe. If you want to share the video of iframe. If you want to embed it in iframe. And if you want to start it in a particular time. You can also do it here. So you can share it in this point. You can see that time. So I will start it here. So I will do it in iframe. I will do it in iframe. I will do it in iframe. I will start it at 1219. And I will put it in my code. I will comment this in iframe. And I will put it in iframe. Okay. I will drop it in iframe. So I will do it in iframe. Now I will paste it. I will show you the document. See this video is here. It is embedded. So I hope you will come to this. And the media is only in HTML. It is pretty much. I will see a lot of things in every topic. But pretty much that's all about media. HTML, audio, video, media is not that much. This is what you will use in 95% of the time. Okay. Now I will give you a quick quiz. And your quick quiz is that create a website which shows videos of different categories. Okay. And audio of different categories. You can use YouTube videos in an iframe using YouTube's emitting feature. Okay. So what you have to do is create a website which will give you a lot of content. Now you will use video audio and tags and use this share feature of YouTube. So I have created this video. You can also embed it in this way. And you can also make a big website and show it to me. You can give me a comment of the chart. And you can also explain it to me with that. But you can try to attempt this quiz. And write in the comment section, write a signature batch. And then you can access the playlist. Like the video. Write a signature batch. Now we will end this video with that. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."}
