this video we will talk about core webwitals and why core webwitals are needed Keep this video like, share and subscribe The website of your phone is in the iphone, android phone, surface, etc. Because we have to give good experience to all users In this video we will also know that the hidden tool in the chrome is called lighthouse and you can use it to enhance your website So write in the comment section below, let us know in the comments section below Let's roll the intro in the computer screen So guys, I have already made a new folder in my computer screen which is called video6 Video6 and here is video6 I will open the VS code as always and the thing I am going to tell you today is that SEO is very important to the aspects First of all, I am going to tell you what is SEO SEO stands for search engine optimization If you see any website, then it is SEO Amazon.in's example Many Amazon.in is open So Amazon.in's chart is that the website is loaded quickly so that the products in search can be found in the product Google has a good response to Google that good users can see good pages So Google only wants to show them that fast information is very good and with that, there are some things that good users can see good For example, there are two pages from the side One page has been told about my dog food The other page has also told about the dog food But the page 2 is very low If it is very low, Google will give it a reference With that, there are a lot of vitals which Google considers to rank two pages First of all, content is the most important on the page of content If you have content, you can also rank the core vitals without your website But if you are competing with a such page with the same content, almost similar quality then your core vitals will be seen and if your core vitals are true then you will be given a reference So your core vitals are the first of your CLS You can see this video here which I have run from the web.dev website You can see that someone comes to your website and the order of canceling the cancel has been canceled by the order of the order and this is visible and it has shifted the layout and the order is complete but the user doesn't want to click the order so the user experience is much worse And as you have seen in this video so we should not be less than CLS Now what is the difference between CLS? Cumulative layout shift means there are loads of layers You can see how many layers you have and the first is to see the people and after that when this load is the part of the item, this shift is all inside If you don't want to shift the layout then you should not shift the layout The next metric that we are talking about is the LCP and LCP stands for largest contextual paint This means the user is doing a page view and the biggest element of that page For example, the biggest part of this image is loaded in so many days or the whole page is loaded but the biggest element of that page is loaded in so many days and the goal of that is to have a good LCP score 2.5 seconds and the biggest element of that page is loaded After that is the third metric which stands for first input delay First input delay means that any user has clicked an input on the element on the button or any input on the page then how much input process is there For example, if you click the button the button click browser and the depth of the web and web is 100ms and the input process should start So these are the three core web vitals which are very important For you all, let me tell you which core web vitals are updated but these three are very important and you should know Now I will show you what the light house report is and what are the values of these three core web vitals So I will tell you if you will inspect the right click and you can see you can click on the right-side or you can click on the right-side and you can click on the right-side I prefer this one because I have never seen this before Now you can see the light house option You can see the light house is basically you can generate a report and you can tell you what the HTML page is For example, if I want to see how my mobile users will see how my mobile users will see I will click on the mobile I will click on desktop I will click on the mobile and click on the analyze page You can see that the report is generated Performance, accessibility, best practices, SE and PW You can see there is a red in the scope of improvement in the page You can see you can see you can see the 2.7 second the first side of the website you can see the light house and if you incorporate these your website will be very big You can see the image elements do not have explicit bit than height You should give the image to the bit than height because we have used the previous video so that you can hit the result of the browser and the result will be in the browser Otherwise, if we don't set the height and bit then what will happen that the browser will not know how much space to reserve and how much CSS load will be we don't want to page loading time shift If we start shifting then when we shift we can click here We will click here I will click here and when I click on the same time this image is loaded and it is shifted and when we click on image it says cumulative layout shift This way, shift does not prefer it does not prefer it is less than cumulative layout shift so that we can get a good experience and we get more suggestions for this for desktop report You can see it has a report it has a performance 192 mbps 75mbps You can see that the scope of improvements is a hidden tool which we should use I will tell you about the MetaTexo MetaDiscruption I will make a new file called index.stml and after making a new file I will tell you the title If you are using the content of your page it is a good SEO practice When you are changing your page you should reflect the content If you want to go to Google you can find the title in the code You can find the title and the title and the title which is the YouTube and the Instagram and the title and the title which reflects the content and reflects the content and the website I will add content and I will add H1 and then I will add a paragraph and I will add a Lorem45 I will add a View I will add a 45 I will add a 45 and I will add a 45 I will add 23 I will add a 45 I will add a preview I will do an open and browser I will add a document and I will not do this I will write about Harry and I will write in the code I will write in the website and I will tell you what is the title It is a good title You can see the content in the website I will add an Inspection and see what is the scope of improvements I will add a scope of improvement There is no such thing when I add it I will add it Add a high-dial, with the same method, I will tell you another trick, You see how your website looks in any mobile, You will be able to find out. You will be able to click here, you will be able to click on the computer, And after that if you choose the responsive, You can see how your website looks in any device, You can see the responsive, And you can see in the device, You can see in the iPhone 12 Pro, Your website is based on the resolution, Now you have to say that it is not a 16 or 12 Pro, It is a very big iPhone device, You can see in this large device, How your website looks in this large device, You can see how your website looks in this big device, You can see how your website looks in the surface pro 7, You can see in the google phone, You can find it also, You can see how your website is in any device, In the case of other devices, You can see in the iPad, We don't have the device, You can choose your device, You can see all your website in different devices, You can see how your website looks in this course, You can see how your website looks in this course, Now you can click here, This is a response view, And as you can see, I will close it, Now I will tell you about the meta-text, There you can see the meta-dec. I will click on Meta. I can give my page description. I know that this is the page. This is a page about. This is a page which contains description about Harry. Okay. And here you can write whatever page content you want. As I show you, you can write what is SEO. What is SEO? You have written what is SEO. See here, this page has given me this meta description. SEO stands for this and symbol terms. Now, it is necessary that a search engine will pass your meta DESC. If it is good, it will pass and keep your meta DESC here. If you have not added a meta DESC, then your content can also be generated by the meta DESC. So, this is the responsibility of this search engine. What will be the goal? I do not know. But from our side, our page should be two-the-point. If we write a blog and we want to write our organically ranked page. So, here you can see that I have written a meta DESC. I used to write a meta keyword. But the meta keyword right now. It is deprecated. The meta keyword is not used yet. The meta keyword is seen in some way. But it is believed that the meta keywords are not ranked in SEO. Because people do more than the views. You have written a page about pets and you have written what is SEO. The meta keyword will be ranked in this way. I will fix this double quotes to the end. If I write a meta keyword, then it will be necessary that a search engine will be considered. If there are some search engines, then they will say that the meta keywords do not accept. I do not see the meta keyword. The meta keyword is not used yet. You can pass the page content. If you are getting the same time, then you can also explain the content. What is your content value? It will be ranked. If you want to know about the core web vital. For example, if I inspect and go to the lighthouse and find a desktop, then some core web vital. Like LCP. Then FCP is the first contextual paint. You can see that everything is 100% 100% 100% You can see that there is no more content in this content. But you can see that you are doing what you are doing. The pages with the web socket cannot enter back forward. The web socket is in cache because we are using extension. Live preview. Otherwise, this is exactly the accessibility. Everything is so much bigger. PWA is the progressive web apps that we will not be able to make. But you can see that the first contextual paint, the largest contextual paint, Total blocking time, cumulative layout shift, speed index. If you want to know about this, then you can go to the web.dev website. You can see that you can learn about this, what is the thing about this. You can learn about this. There is a lot of good content about this. But we will focus on the websites of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web sites. This is the thing that you should have told us about. If you haven't done the development series yet, then do do it. Do click on the star and save it. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time."}
