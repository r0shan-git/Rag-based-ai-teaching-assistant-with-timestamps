    "text": " Today we will start the SIGMA web development course with this video We will start with this video with this high energy Because in this video, I will be making a profitable web developer with zero This course is a modern world because web development has changed over time There are many new things There are many things in JavaScript that are very easy to work with There are many technologies that will make you work very hard These course will be for those people who don't know anything You know zero once about web development course We will start with zero but we will continue to raise the bar What we will learn is that in this course, I will tell you in a few days Web development is a very profitable thing I have made a lot of money through web development And my main thing is that you can learn a lot of web development Like course, you will learn notes, cheats, cheats, references This course will be a little different Because I will learn all the technologies that I have experienced in this course And I will make a complete course with all the web development technologies The course content will be complete web development, front and back and database Which you should learn as much as possible I will tell you in a few days what will be the course content But you will be able to keep trust that you will be a full stack developer You will be able to do a lot of projects In the course of the course and in the end, some good projects will be made So that you can get a lot of strong ones on web development I have learned the best way to learn project based learning So I will make a lot of projects and if you agree, then write in the comment section Because when you comment, it gets spied on my face So comment, I want to give you a lot of advice To finish this course, you will get an end to the start of the website And in this course, I will also make a lot of websites like you Your confidence will go up So let's start with the first video of your development course with your sigma web development course Let's roll the intro Alright guys, I have already in my computer screen And as I am doing like this, you guys follow me I have downloaded Google Chrome browser and you also download Google Chrome browser I am not doing this, but you guys have to do exactly the same thing as the beginner who is doing this So here we will follow a gum like I am doing And with that, you will get exactly the same videos as you will follow I will go to Google quickly and I will write download VS code What is this VS code? It is a source code editor If you click on Windows, you will get Windows If you are in Mac, Linux, or any other operating system You can download VS code for that feature operating system And you can see exactly the same process That my download folder is in here Here is the VS code And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded I will refresh you And here you can see the VS code setup You can install it So simply install VS code Install the game as easy as possible You can easily use this slide and up slide And then I will accept the agreement I will accept it And I am the fastest reader in the world I will do it Next, next Check both icons Check both icons Check the settings If you want to get a shortcut, then you can get a shortcut And then you can get a shortcut And then install it If your PC is fast, then it will be fast But if you are a PC, then it is slow So there is no problem with the shortcut So it will be slow, and there is nothing more Now I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel Because these videos, I want to download the video as you follow So if you want to follow this course, then you should subscribe With that said, our VS code is downloaded I have opened my VS code Don't be scared, don't be scared And I am telling you again If you are already coming Beginner is taking the start of the video But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming video So stay tuned I will request you to tell me in the comment section Your level, beginner, advanced, intermediate users Tell me in the comment section where you can get a web development Beginner, advanced, intermediate Please comment Now what is the VS code here? I have downloaded it as a Q I think it is So if you don't know the beginner, let me tell you The VS code is a code editor Which helps you edit the code Now you can also edit the code in the node pad So yes, in the kernel node pad, it will also be in that Yes, I am not doing it in the casteically Or I will setup it here And I will show you what it is Which makes it a little different from the node pad Now let's setup it quickly I will not do it without the color themes In fact, I will do it I will put dark mode on the theme Next section, next section You can also turn this welcome to the next section But there are some tips you are telling That's it The VS code here is already started You can see the screen of this VS code You can make new files, new folders But I will recommend you to turn it off Yes, you can turn it off I am going to make a new folder And I am going to keep it in the name of the folder You guessed it right Now let's do the course We will do everything in this course We will do everything We will do everything We will do it later If you will do the shift in the windows You can see that the option of open with code is now This option of open with code is You can open this particular folder In the VS code You can select it What will you do here? You can choose this file and then select this You can open this folder And then click on the plus You can make a new file I have written here index.html Please write it down What I am writing to you Enter the name of the folder What I will do I will write here I am your first HTML file I have written this You can see that the window white This window means You won't save this file I will recommend you to go to file or auto save option. As you type, you will not see the end of file. You will instantly save files. I will also recommend this. We will not use control S. If you want to save control S, you can disable this option. You can click on the gear and settings. And search for mouse. Now you will see the mouse wheel. Check it and see what will happen. Just check it and turn it on. Now you have to be sure why is the VS code. Why is this? Why is this? Why is this? But you can't see it. Now you can just scroll from this side. So what happens? The font size of your phone is changed. Now I will show you a magic. It is very simple logic. In downloads, what is the name of the web development course in the folder. This file is made in index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. I know that this.txt is made in this file. Let me make this file. This is this. So what happens? This file is also made here. Now you can see. So this folder and the VS code are going in sync. Now open this file from here. And I will show you this file in this node. So I can do that too. That too is my idea. But I will not use this node. Because in VS code, there are some such things that do not give me the node. And I want that I will get the features. I don't want to overrun you guys. But I will show you that in VS code, what is the node that you don't get the node. If I write you, I will get HTML. I will enter this. This is automatically opened closing tag. If I get the exclamation mark here, then I will click on a boiler plate. I will click on this. This is the basic code of HTML. And then I will start the chat. You guys should not overrun you guys. But I want to tell you that this is the way we get the VS code. We did not use the node pad. And this is how much we are getting. This is how much we are getting. This is how much we are getting. This is how much we are getting. So it will come to the convenience of coding. Now I want to comment on Mac and Linux users. I want to comment on exactly similar things. I am using Windows. I have Windows Laptop. I cannot use it on three laptops. Linux Mac and Windows 3 are not used together. So you will be able to use exactly the same thing. In fact, I want to say that it is similar. It is exactly the same. It is very similar. So you guys will be able to follow along. It is very easy. Don't take tension. I will tell you about some extensions. You will be able to enjoy some extensions. You must get through extensions. It was also fun. I had liar comment! But i will tell about that in a short distance. And basically this is scrimalally underrated, so tell me if I jable. So tell me if I jable. I would like to tell you all. In this case I would like to tell you. Rightly clicking the command format, if Apple gets completely fiddled up, we will have many options over the VS code. Everything you need to know about these options. We will come in and go ahead of the course. I could say this feature that is used. I would like to tell you all these features. But in this case I would like to tell you. I will do a screen cast mode. I will not do this, but I will do it. I clicked. I will type something. I have clicked the caps lock. I will know when I have clicked the consub button. I will not recommend this thing for you. Screen cast mode. We can change the settings from here. You can see the screen cast mode's vertical offset. I will do vertical offset. I will do this. I will do this. I will do 60. I will do 60. I will do 80. I will do this. From bottom to top. I have done 0. I will type something. I will do this. I will do this. I will close this text file. I will close this text file. I will close this text file. I will close this text file. I will close this text file. I hope you will understand this. You can see what the steps will be. You can close the step by coming to the setup list. If you are Zooming, you can have a look. I will record video. I am doing zoom in because I am recording videos I want you to watch it from the side But when I am coding, I don't zoom as much You guys don't have to pay attention to this These are related things from VSCode I want to tell you how websites work One is basically 3 people work for you Imagine 3 people One is client brother One is server brother Who is client brother? Who is another server brother? Who is another brother? Who is a brother who is a father? Brother is a brother So brother is a brother, client brother is server brother What is this client? What is this server brother? I am a client You are the one who use the browser This is Chrome Hello Chrome I am a client I am a client When I write code with Harry.com I know code with Harry.com So what do I say? I am saying I am writing code with Harry.com website I write code with Harry.com I write YouTube.com I say YouTube.com website I say browser I want to see YouTube.com What is browser? You want YouTube? I will enter the YouTube.com So I have got the server with YouTube.com Now I have got the server with YouTube.com And then I have parsed it And I have shown this screen This work is so fast Because my internet.com is very fast This is so much work But still My locality is fast So this fast internet is very fast With this fast internet speed So client server is a request Send a browser I will send a browser I will help you with the server Who is managing the server? YouTube.com and the server is written in the server I send the code in this way When I write YouTube.com, I write this code How to convert this code into a browser? I have to show it in this way So, client browser says If something tells something like It is not a server.com As the serverrai rolls the code from my eating chart I give it to my server There is no error or server error. All the responses should be 200. 200. The browser is back with the client. I hope you are clear. So, we have a browser server. This is how it works. Let me tell you one more time. Google.com Client is called as Google.com Let me bring you Google.com. I also bring you Google.com. You can give it to Google.com. Google.com is a server that is all images, videos, etc. This is how it works. It also works as a browser that is displayed in a size. The server is a bundle. Pass the bundle and show it to the browser. The user will interact with the browser. I will directly inspect and go to network. I will write here. I have sent all the requests for images. I have sent all the requests. You will have to interact with the browser. You can give it to a restaurant. You have ordered it. You have taken a waiter. You have sent it to the server. Finally, the waiter gave the order. He could have ordered it. The waiter was not able to order it. You can order it. You can order it. You can order it for an error. You can order it for an error. You can order it whenever you want. It is an ok response. You can also get a restaurant like this. When you click Google.com slash mail, then you can see Google.com slash mail available. And if you click Code with Airy.com slash contact, then you can see Code with Airy.com slash contact. Or you can also see Phone Not 4 or 500. You can see a 500 page. Whatever server you will send, you will see. This cycle is running. Client Requests, Browser, Server, Request, Processing, and then the server sent the data back to the browser. And the browser showed the client. Then the client did something, the server sent the server to the same request. The server sent the data to the client. The browser came back and so on. So now you all are fine. But what is the background? The background is that the server is processing the request. If you have a blog, you will have a lot of data inside the blog. So what you will do is, store every web page in your blog. Or you will generate that content dynamically. You will generate that content dynamically. I will take Google's example. If I search for a Harry By. You can see that the header of Google is this link. This format doesn't change. If I click here, I have written Shubham. So I will write Shubham. Now see, when I wrote Harry By, I have written a similar content. So what Google does? The server is the backend. The backend process does data in this way, that it sends the corresponding to HTML. So when Shubham writes this, when Harry By writes, then this sends. So to generate this, the process of the system is the backend. Now this is the backend of the Django. This is the backend of the Flash. This is the node of the backend. This is the backend Ruby on Rails. And the database of the backend is used. The backend node doesn't show the client. This is the front end node that sends the server. And how did the server make this code? I don't know. Because it is running on the server. If you are confused, then you can be confused. You will understand everything. We will come to the backend. Now we understand that how the front end works. The front end is made from 3 languages. HTML, CSS and Java. These are 3 languages. Because if you are making a website, if you are making a website, every HTML, CSS and Java script in most of the cases, if you only use HTML, then it becomes a very basic, skeleton website. And CSS, when you use it, you can style it. So it is showing on the button. Along with that, the button is showing red, the button is showing from the curve. This is the size of CSS. You are seeing edges. This is the size of CSS. So CSS works. We are going to style it. What color will be the button? What will be the color? These are all the CSS's. So it is a beauty. It is a HTML page. HTML is the name of the body. Some people understand that it is a standard. If you are making any website, it will be made in HTML. So that the browser is able to parse it. It is a work of the browser. It is a part of HTML. And HTML is a skeleton. It is a standard. Any website will be made in HTML. It will be used in skeleton HTML. It is a standard. So that everyone can make the same pages. And if someone is making any browser, then they have to parse the same language. If you have learned 80% HTML, then you are good to go for web development. Now HTML becomes something directly. Like I am writing a lot of HTML code. So I am writing HTML code from this way. I am writing an Excel mission mark mark. I am using the method of M8 abbreviation. You guys don't have to worry about it. I have written it in this way. I will write this as HTML. And I can open this HTML file directly. And as I open this HTML file directly, you can see this will open from this way. I can open this directly. I have actually double-clicked it in this way. And it is open. You can see this is HTML written from this. But this is not styled. This HTML file is very basic. Now you can run directly videos from HTML. I have an HTML file, which I will show you. You can run videos from this. I work on this HTML file, and I will show you the video. So in this HTML, there is a video tag. If the video will enter, then the video will play in the SRC. Like I have already shown the video 1.10 before. Now you can see the video 1.10 before. This is the file. You can use the video code. You can see here that I will reload it. So here is the video. I can play it automatically. To play, I have to click on Control. And I will refresh it. So I will play it. I can play it. This is the magic. To make it look big, you need to use it. 1.30 and the final build. Now if I add video 2.mp4 here. I added video 1. I have 2 more videos. I have them. If I add them, then I will refer them. I will show you the video 2.mp4. I will reload this video. So what are you doing? I will use the Benstokes. Now I will do the video 3. I will do the third video. I will reload this video. And you can see that I will play. Yes sir. I will play the video 3. I will reload this video. I will play it. I will do the third video. I have loaded the video 3. I will do the third video. I will close this video. And I can also do the video 4. And the video 4. I have a DJ video. I have DJ. So see this. Chaburana. Pichiroko. Pichiroko. Pichiroko. You can make this video. You don't need to use this only. You don't need to do anything else. You can play videos with only this. You can play images with this. You can play all this with this. If you want to style it, I want to add a border here. You have to add a border here. You have to add a border here. You have to use CSS. CSS adds beauty on any website. Then Javascript. You can add interaction on any website. For example, what will happen when I click on search. What will happen when I click on code with Harry. The code with HR and auto complete. Why did I come here? Because I have requested this server. And for this query, auto complete results are here. So all these things are from Javascript. We call this as client side scripting. We want to do scripting here. We want to do coding. But we can do it. Javascript is from the side. This is also a brain. So our website is called beauty with brain. I am talking about website. Beauty with brain. CSS adds beauty. Now Javascript helps you to make a dynamic page. If you want to change content, then Javascript is from Javascript. If you want to get all these things, I will kill all these things. I am working on my record. Oh my god! I will like the video because I also eat crore. When I was in college, I had a spoon and went to Javascript. I had to learn Javascript. I learned it before. I learned it before. But this is wrong. Because HTML is only 80%. And CSS is only 47%. And Javascript is only 50-70%. You can start web development. You can make projects. You can come forward. Next course, I will tell you about chat. What is the impact of chat about web development? I will tell you about it. You will be a team. So don't forget to take HTML and CSS. I will do it for the next year. I will do it for the next year. I will do it for the next year. I will make it for the next 4 years. I will do it for the next 4 years. HTML and CSS is 40-70%. And Javascript is 50-70% You can make a big website. And as soon as you make a website, you will experience your HTML and CSS. And you will not even know that you have made a perfect script. While you are making money and working as a professional web developer, you will be learning and learning. And you will be able to make your skills. So, I will learn all HTML's tags. I will learn all the CSS's tags. I will learn all the Javascript tags. I will learn all the Javascript tags. I will learn all the tags. I will learn all the tags. And I don't want you to learn only for the next year. So, I have designed this course with this design. So, you will learn all the things that matter. And you will learn the practice. And you will learn all the things in this course. I will do it for the next year. Sigma web development course has been launched for 2-3 years. Which is good. We are learning HTML and CSS. And you will learn all the CSS's tags. And I will tell you all the tricks in this course. Which you will not hear. And I will tell you all the tricks in this course. I have learned a lot of tricks in my career. And I want you to learn all the tricks. If you have doubts in these videos, You can use the hashtag hashtag hashtag. And you can ask your doubts. I will try to answer all the doubts. I will try to keep my entire course. Your doubts are solved. So, if you have any questions, Please write them down. Please write them down in the comments. And don't write them down. So that I can do the comments that I will write down. I will try to answer all the doubts. As much as I can. And you will learn all the tricks in this course. So, if you haven't done this course yet, Then you will have to write them down in the comments. Now, what is the next thing, what is the next thing, What is the next thing, what is the next thing, So, see all these things that are used in the front end of the framework Or you will help in using JavaScript. So, HTML and CSS is made from JavaScript. This process is made from JavaScript. How? We will learn in this course. Yes, we will learn in this course. I told you that I will make a course. I will make a course that you will take from 0 to Web Development And take from 0 to Web Development. Because you have taken the ticket and you have taken the signal of Web Development Express. A great analogy that you want to give to people is to use HTML and CSS to teach JavaScript. HTML is just like car skeleton. Because of that, CSS is painted and internal engine is applied. So, it is JavaScript. Look at the example of a human being. So, the skeleton is HTML. After that, the skin is applied. So, CSS is applied. And the brain is applied. The nervous system is JavaScript. Now, I will take the folks to Forbes.com. If you go to Forbes, you will see that there is a website here. And the Forbes.com is used in HTML and CSS in JavaScript. It is used in other websites. Now, if I click on right click on inspect, then you will see that this inspect element is opened. Now, look here, you have used the script in the head. And for the CSS to add here, they have used the link. So, what I will do here? The CSS I will remove from here. So, what I will do is to remove CSS. All the styles and all the things I will do, I will do this to delete them. So, I will remove all the styles and all the links and tags. So, as I have deleted all the styles and stuff, look at the condition of this page. This page is showing in the way they have only HTML. What do I want to do? How do I want to do this? And I have just removed all these. And I have just removed the raw HTML, the Cubs.com's condition has been added, without the CSS. It has only shown raw buttons, raw text, raw links. Similarly, I will remove the script and see how to turn on the JavaScript website. Now, if I delete this HTML tag, I have deleted all these. I have deleted all these. It has become a blank page, it is not seen as the HTML. This is how the JavaScript has been created.

And then, you guys will be asking me to watch your videos. No one will be able to read it. So, I hope you guys have understood the request in this video. The response is like how all the websites work. A basic idea is that, how is the client's server interaction? In the coming videos, we will see how the website is made. We will make our first website in the next video. So, we should be very excited about the excitement. Because, in the next video, our first website is going to be made.
