see how images are made in HTML and table. So, if you like the video, I know a lot of people like YouTube videos. But if you do, thanks to the support of you all, I get the motivation to bring free courses like this. So, let's start the 5th video of SIGMA Webloff Lab and the 5th video. Let's roll the intro. So, guys, I have already seen the video in the computer screen. First of all, I want you to know that you can buy the GETUP.COM slash code in Dharik. So that you can get all the code. Second, you can click on the playlist and click on the star. And then you can save it. Now, I will tell you the first thing about the image. In HTML, what is the image? So, what we will do here will be a folder. New folder of video 5, you can come here and click on the SHIFT RIDE. Open with code is very expensive. I will tell you later. But if you want to see the new folder, you can click on the new folder. So, click on the new folder. And then click on the show welcome page and startup. And you can click on the new folder. But what we are doing is, we will make the HTML and the controls of the index. We will zoom in and do the screen and do the screen and the support of the screen. So that you will know what kind of buttons I am in and why I am in the next one. Now, I will take the exclamation mark and take the image abbreviation. And here I will do the view and draft. I will have to work hard here. You can see here that your board draft has been turned off. So, here you will not be able to do the horizontal scroll. Now, what I will do here is, I will write images. First, I will write images. And I will simply do what I will do here. I will take an image. Now, I can bring the image from the internet. I will write here. Let us take an image and come to train. Okay, train images. Because we have run a lot of trains in this course. So, we will write the images of the train. We will write some images. I will do the same image. And here, I will do the same image of the sigma web development course in the video number 5 folder. This is a CMS file. In fact, I will do a work in this case. I will do a cancel. I will take a snap. Because I am going to go to the PNG and choose it. So, I have shot the windows, shift and S-divaya. I have shot the sleeping tool and you do not know. Now, you will know the sigma web development course. You will know that if you will go to windows, shift and S-divaya, then your sleeping tool will be opened in windows. Do not know about this. In the comment section, you will know the image from the Imam Daddy. Now, what will we do here? I have done the windows shift S. I have started talking. So, click here and save it. This floppy disk option is saved here. Now, click here. And go to the downloads. Go to sigma web development course. Go to the video 5Mit. Image. Okay, image saved. Now, it is an IMG tag in HTML. Now, the IMG, like you will put, All the S-rc and all the attributes required are required. In fact, if you do not write all the attributes, then it will be recommended. I will tell you what are the attributes. First of all, if you click in S-rc, you can see the image.png. You can see the image here. I will put the image. I will put the image in the old. Now, if you have seen the image, then you will preview it. See, this is the page of our image. What is the point of writing all the attributes? You can say, I will tell you where the all the attributes are. You can see, the things that are in the old, I have not seen that. Manlo, for some reason, you cannot see the image. Okay? What will happen? I have written the image too. Now, image2.png, your file is not here. So, what will happen? What will happen? What will happen? So, the all the attributes will be displayed. And this way, the error image will be displayed. Which will tell you that you have put the image. It is written from the right. You have given it something. Here, the image of the server that you have given, is not here. Okay, this way, it is shown like this. And it shows the all the attributes there. And the difference is that, what is the difference between the image and the all the attributes. And if I come back here, you can write all the attributes here. I will not write all the attributes here. I will not write all the attributes here. I will not write all the attributes here. So, you will not want that when your server is in error, you will see the image. From this way, the scenario is made. You can see the user's image from this way. The train has written this way. Okay? I hope you understood. Image1 is straightforward. There are two more attributes that are very important. So, it is a bit. It is written in pixels. If I write 23, then you can see it. In fact, I will correct the image. I have written the image too. I have written the image too. Image.png. So, here you can see it. I have written 23 pixels. Because it is very small. So, I will write 23 pixels. I will write it in this. You do not need to write it in Px. You can write in CS. When we write the weight, we will see that we need to write Px. Here, only if we write the weight, then we write double quotes. Like you can see it. Okay? So, if I take it here, then you can see that, this small image is written in the weight. If I give it a height, I mean, I will give it a height, but if it is from this height, then the spectrum of this size would be quite much. It would be slightly stretched. Because, how do I say its leader? Even the width of this age has its height. Even the height of this age has its height, just as you can see it. If you want height, then how do I say it is of that size? And if you want the width automatically adjust it. Then use the height together. Now you have to lionize the height. So, there is high morgen's trend. And if you want height of this height, then use the height with which its height would be adjusted. If you value its height, then the height of it will increase. Now, such a high textured weight will arise. As far as you can see it, you will see it. and the height of the device is not enough. Now, what happens is that the CSS can be adjusted through the white thread. And we will see in the CSS section, why do we always set the white thread in this section? We always need to set the white thread in one thing. Such that, when the page is loading, the image of the page is coming from the bottom of the image. I will tell you in the coming videos. But now, you understand that these white and white attributes are not used in many people. They say that they are deprecated or not used. But I will tell you in the coming videos, why do we need to use this type of image? I will tell you in the coming videos, where I will tell you about core web vitals and SEO. Now, you will see that the image of the image of the image is going to be hit. The image of the image is going to be hit. So, the second one is automatically set. And these values are in pixels. And you don't have to write a pixel on the pixel. You have to write a number on the pixel. And that's it. This is an attribute. It is a height and an SRC attribute. It is called a attribute. You can use the style attribute. In fact, you can use all the tags with the attribute. So, this is the image. Now, we will talk about the tables in this table. The table tag is very useful in HTML. What is the table tag? I will tell you. You can see the table tag. I copy the table from here. And when I copy the table, you can see the page that I have shown in this way. So, this table is called the table. Where is my previous page? Or, look, name, Harry age 100. Now, if I add more things in my knowledge, I will add something like name, name, and designation, Harry designation, and I will add something else. And I want to add more things in my knowledge. I will use all ship bottom. I will use all ship bottom. And I want to write from here that I want to write my favorite language. I want to write my knowledge. It is JavaScript. Now, you can see that table will be named, name, destination, favorite language. So, what is this? Let me tell you how to do this. Here, you can see that table tag is used. Table tag is called TR tag. What will come in this row? You will see that. Now, if you want to use table heading, you can say that table is rho. This is rho. This is rho. Name, destination, and your favorite language. What will come in this row? And what will come in this row? You can see that it will be a heading. So, I will use TH. TH means table heading. And we will write this only once. So, the first one will be TR. We will write TH. Once we have added heading, then we will add data. So, we will add table rho to TD. Which stands from table data. And here, as much as we add this way, we will add rows. So, what will come in this row? You will add rows. I will write in my knowledge. Sam. And this is also a programmer. And I will add rows to this. This is the favorite language of Java. You can see that it will be added to table. You can see that rows are added. And CSS. We will see how it can be ordered. It can be styled. But it is given by default. And we know that this is the next one. But you can just understand that table works in the same way. Now, rho span and callspan attributes. Now, you can see here that rho span means how much rho span will span your TD. For example, Let us write in my knowledge. I want Sam and programmer to take a cell. I want Sam to write in 2 cell. I want Sam to write in 4th. And I want Sam to write. And I want to write that callspan is equal to 2. So, callspan is equal to 2. It means Sam will take 2 columns. What does it mean? Sam will take 2 columns. It means Sam will show you how Sam will do it. I will show you. It means he took all columns. So, the callspan will be how many columns will be lost. By default, one column will be lost. But one cell will be lost. To demonstrate this thing, I will explain to you about the axles. You will understand that this table is HTML. I will sometimes say that I will spend 2 columns for one data. So, here we use merge cell. And I want Sam to write here. This is what is used in HTML. Callspend is used. Sometimes we want to merge vertically. I mean, I want to merge these two cells. We use rho span there. And we will use rho span. And we will use rho span. We will use TD. We will use callspend. We will use rho span. We will use rho span. We will use rho span. So, I hope you guys understood. When we will make tables, we will make HTML. Then you will understand better. But I will show you how to use rho span. If I write rho span as 2. And I will write here one more TR. So, you will see that this is the table. Now, I will add CSS style here to explain better. I will add a style sheet. And I will keep the style sheet in my name. Style.CSS. So, in Style.CSS. And you guys can understand CSS. I will already tell you. I will write in TD. I will write in border 2 pixel solid black. And you guys will know how to do this. But now you understand that I have added this. I will explain to you. So, I said that this is the necessary parameter of this. And I said that the sample of this is how much rho span. I gave it to rho span. I said that my java is rho span 2. So, how much rho span will be taken? Obviously, 2. So, here is 2 rho span. So, you can see here, the java has taken 2 rho span. So, when the java has taken 2 rho span, I don't want to add java anymore. Because I have already added its rho. So, I will not add java here. I have taken this coil span 2. So, what can we see from this? This was a Harry programmer, java script. Then I said that the sample of this coil span has taken 2 columns. This one will take 2 columns. And this one will take 2 rows. So, you can see here, exactly the same. It took 2 rows. So, this can be used as a rho span of coil span. In HTML. In HTML table, we can add captions. And to add captions, we can use some captions. So, I will show you. In the caption, we will use student details. I will tell you, I will show you some details. So, the page you can see here. The caption will be added here. Now, CSS changes it. It has a font size. But, now, we can see some details. The caption is added here. You can also add header and footer. You can give it T-head or T-foot. If I add some content in T-head or T-foot, I will add header and footer. You can see T-head and footer. You can see here, header and footer. Now, I will tell you about one more tag. The tag will be called BR tag. You can see here, it is below. So, this header is below. And then, I will add footer. I will not add here. So, all the tables are below. I will add the end. This is my table footer. Now, I can change CSS. I can add T-head and footer content in T-foot. So, what is the header of my table? I can add T-head content in T-head. The content inside the table will be in T-body. So, what will be in T-body? This is a table content. You can see here. And, if I write T-foot here, I want to add some data in the end. I will add a T-R. I will document it in the right way. It will be better format. I want to add T-R in T-foot. So, this is the way it is grouped. I added T-foot in T-body. I added T-head content in T-body. And, I added T-head content in T-head. The header of my table. And, obviously, I have not changed anything. I have just grouped it. I will write the footer content here. So, I will write the footer content here. I can see here. The last one is the footer. What is the benefit of doing this? We have just grouped it so that we can target it. So, you will use it very less. But, you can do it in the same way. You can come here with the whole table. The footer content will come here. And, the body content will come in between the header and the footer. But, you can write it in any way. But, ideally, the head of the body will come after that footer. Okay? I hope you all understood. So, that's all about HTML tables. It is not necessary to know more about the people. And, now, we will talk about the list. List of the list is very important in HTML. Because, the list is very important. There are 3 other lists in HTML. There is an ordered list. There is an ordered list. There is a definition list. The most used ones are the ordered list. Let's look at the ordered list. Sometimes, we want to have an ordered data. I will write here UL. So, I will write here UL as I will write here. That means, that is an ordered list. I can write it in this. I can write it in Harry. And, I can write it in Ruhan. Okay? And, I can write it in this. Shubham. So, when I will write Harry Ruhan Shubham, I will write it in UL. It will come from this way. Look, Harry Ruhan Shubham is here. There is no order here. If I want to have an ordered list, I can write it in the same way. If I want to have an open closing tag in UL, and other things are the same. So, this will be ordered list. Okay? This is 1, 2, 3. You can do even the PVCB. You can do the Roman numbers. You can do the CSS with the Saita. You can do it in any way. You can see here. If you have an UL, you can do it in this way. You can see the image. If you have an UL, you can do it in this way. This is the order list example. And, this is the definition list example. The definition list is very less used. It is a preview of this. First, I have written the first one. DL means definition list. DT means DD. So, definition term is term. It is definition of definition. This is something like this. You can change it in CSS too. But, you should know about this. For interviews. If you ask me what is the definition list. Then, I will also write a preview of this. I will also write a preview of this. But, try it out. First, we will see the first one. You have to tell the person in the order list. You can use the type attribute of this. You can customize the bullet points. Type attribute. If I want to add type. I will add type. Type is equal to. I will also write the square. I have written the type of UL. This is the square. I can circle the type of UL. I can do it in this way. I can do it in this way. I can do it in this way. I can also do it in this way. I can also do it in this way. Along with that. You can add more list items in this list. Now, let's see the order list. If you write the order list in this list. You can write the order list in this list. 1,2,3. But, you can use the type of UL. When you use the type of UL. You will get the number of cases. You will get the lower case number. Type is equal to 1. You will get the small case number. You will get the alphabetical. You will get the capital. What is the alphabetical. I will write the type of UL. I will write the capital. We have given examples of UL. We are worried that we will get the possible values. VSCode is very useful. Many people used old editors. They used the same. If you know about their plugins. You will get a lot of new ones. VSCode is modern. You will get the most developed VSCode. If you want to do a review on our website. You can use it with your hands. If you want to use a shout out. You can use it with your hands. You can use it in your mobile. If you don't have a computer, you can use it with your hands. If you have a computer, you can use it with your hands. If you get the templates, you can cover more in this video. But, I will stick to VSCode. I hope you have understood. Here is the order list. I want to comment on the first video of SIGMA web development series How do you like the 5 stars? What is the initial review of this course? I know that the order is delayed but the DIGMA is delayed I don't do it in YouTube comments But I want to comment on the first video I want to comment on the first video And I want to write in the comments An.R.S.V wallpaper I travel through Amazon The frozen MV is filled with lots of different I am making video after filming"}
