what are the ideas and classes? The concept of the idea and classes is very confusing In fact, when I was learning HTML, I was very confused in my early days In the idea and classes, the idea was unique identity If you gave an idea, you will not give the idea of the second element But the class means that if you want to give multiple elements, you will give it multiple classes For example, you can give a div to a red name and a form From that, you can give a physical name to a red name and a header to a vertical tag Do like this video because we will go to the computer screen and we will go to the computer screen and let's roll the intro Guys, I am back and if you guys have not access to Sigma Web development course, then you can click on the playlist and save it And the source code is also on the top floor Now you can see the folder in the folder and the video number 9 is now ready I will make a folder of your video I will make a video 9 and after making a video, I will try to create a folder of your video And you can see that this is opened in the BS folder I will write the index.html, I will enter and then enter the exclamation mark And with that, now I will tell you what are the ideas and classes You guys will only be responsible for not having any ideas Now, do not write in the comments that I have an idea Whenever you go to any place, you have to show your ideas To prove your identity in some of the cases Now, you guys have to understand the time of the class and class The idea is that you have to recognize your own ideas So, listen to the story here This is John and this is Harry These two are very good friends They are very good friends They do not share their lunch and other friends are very good They do not have any ideas in the food They are friends Now you can see that this is John and Harry He is the idea of his own ideas This is my number And John's number is something like this So, this is John's number And this is my number We both have the same number Or if you believe that our friends are friends We believe that my friends are friends Tanya and John's friends are friends We believe that this is the beginning So, their number is also different This is the beginning And this is the beginning of the story This is the beginning of the story Now, this is the beginning of the story I will tell you about every person This is Harry friend John's friend is the number of his own ideas There are no same numbers in these four If I tell you about every person I will tell you about every person I will tell you about every person You understand Harry's number And if I tell you When one is 6.5.7 I will understand that it is the beginning And if I tell you 4.5.7.7.7 You understand Tanya's number So, he identifies uniquely Tanya's number, Harry's, Shruti's and John's So, what is this? This is the number of his ideas This number won't be found in any other person Okay? Along with that I have shared my childhood with John and Harry They were both in the same class And that class's name was Class 10th I am both in the same class Okay, I believe I believe that And Shruti is one class 9th And Tanya is one class 9th And Tanya is one class 9th Okay? So, both are in class 9th Okay? Tanya is in class 9th And Shruti is in class 9th So, what is Shruti's class 9th? Tanya's class can be 9th But I have to study for the next class Or if Harry has to study for the next 10th class And also if he is a child So, the class means That in one class Harry and John So, can a person be multiple? One person can be multiple So, it means Harry is in class 10th And this is in a tuition Where this class is in class 10a And this is in a tuition So, it is more than one class One is class 10th And one is class 10a And along with that It is called as the D-shirt of the Harry red color So, this class is also ready Okay? So, it means The class of studies It means that This class has been classified in this class Now, come here This is John and Harry Shruti Okay? Let it delete Let it delete from the zoom out Okay? It means Now, let's talk about the index I understand this I know that I have made a div And I have given this class a red Okay? And I have made a span And I have given this class a red Okay? I have given the classes I can give the same class But if I want to add an ID In any element I know that I have added this key first I can add anything in the ID So, I don't want to add any other element in this Because this is the card of this element If it can be given to another dev Then it can be added Then I have to add something Okay? Okay? I have given the second div Okay? And I write the second here And I will write the first link here Okay? So, this ID and the concept of classes I personally I understood it very well When I was learning about the map And I learnt about it in my early days I didn't tell anyone The ID that identifies uniquely This element And the class can also be applied in one element And can also be applied in one class I can also apply it in multiple elements You understand? As I gave this to Red class I can give it to BGL Okay? BGL I can give it to one class And if we give an element to multiple Then we apply space As I want In this element We have added multiple classes So, what I will do? I will write red here Then I will apply space And write BGL So, I can give multiple classes I can give the same element Can I give the same element to multiple ID Because you have to write 2000 cards If you become a guy I dont know New clothes New clothes Ne \u043e\u0431ht One character And one is The modern\u044c Rotations \uc88b\uc544 It's unphasely But the class In a kars So, with light We will get multiple people who like to play or play the game So they will make a game in Manlo Or they are in the Graves class So we can play in a class And we can give the same class to other elements So I hope you understood this Now I will write CSS And don't say that CSS is not a big deal Now what I am writing in CSS is I am writing some alien language Okay In the style of CSS I will click here And now I will show you the preview First or Second I will show you one thing I am writing in CSS And I will write in dot And hash first div And I will write in dot Okay If I say I will write in background So I will write in background And I will write in background And I will write in CSS And now I don't want to confuse you And I can comment in CSS Okay But we will write all these things Now I will write in dot red And in dot bgll I will write in dot bgll I have to write dot I mean class I will write in background And I will write in background And I will write in background And I will write in dot red And then it will be in background And then it will be in background So you can use it In CSS I hope you all will understand And one thing to note here It is very important That the class of the class is from the attribute And the class of the attribute So what are the class of the class Or not the elements of the class of the class Now one more thing is the ID I tell you what more the ID is If I write in the video of the video And I will write in the coding I will write in the same page And then you can see In the video of Wikipedia So what can you do In the particular link of the place I will show you how I will write in the same page And I will inspect the ID And check the ID And I will copy it And if I add the hashtag And I will enter the ID I will enter and I will bring it here And then you can add it in the coordinate And I will scroll And show that particular ID And scroll it And show it with this And I will scroll it And then it will work in the link And that's the ID And you can even generate links And you can buy an ID And if you are opening that link And you can focus on that And in this case You can see I am entering and I am not sure if I have done wrong idea but you got the point here You got the point here 29.29 and I am entering and I am not going to see it now I am going to reload the calendar tab and you will see I am not going to see it now I am going to scroll it up and after that I am going to open the new tab and I am going to scroll it up and bring it to the page which page is the ideal idea I hope you guys understood the ideal and the idea and the idea of this video The idea is the same as the class, one person's property is red or the other in which class is it? You can get multiple classes in one element, one element red and the other element is yellow and the other element is red and the other element is yellow So you can get multiple elements in red class You can get red class in one element and you can get red class in one element You can get bgll class in another element I hope you guys understood In this video I am reading captions and I am getting ready to read captions I needed to say that in next 5-10 minutes like forever, I needed to say 5,000 times and I used to say access and name your village land So that's how to access playlist like and didhove so sure do like and subscribe my channel at the comments sectionAAAA please like and comment as a big big big big big name"}
