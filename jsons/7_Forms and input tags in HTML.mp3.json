No, you know the form It means it is a real form Because it gets reserved We get the form of IDJ And the form of the need We get an exam form So that our data can reach Until we want it So this is the form The HTML form tag Like you will write the form Enter This way You have already asked the first question What is the action of your form? Get your post Get request of post requests I will tell you a very quick difference We will come and see this thing When we will be working on the back end Get request is very simple request And post requests Now we will send these most of the cases When we have a lot of data If we post them So we will use post requests in most of the cases And what is the get request of this? It is very simple request We have to tell the server And that's it We have to hit the server From request Starts it But if you don't understand That should be fine It is not a problem Because we will come to do it in detail So the form action is equal to post Now I can show you some input tags What are the input tags you will tell people? What are your elements in your form? Like you can add date You can add form in it You can tell the name You can say phone number You can say this Your age is only number You can add form in this way I want to tell you That you can add input tags in the form And a label tag Which is used to label the input So what I will show you The simplest input tag is Type is equal to text So I will put the text in the input And you can see If you zoom out So you can see the input text And the user name And the user name And the user name And the action will be given in this way So you can say enter your user name And the user name You will have to enter the user name I will write a text And I will write it Malo form to apply For TAA For Sigma Web Dev TAA Sigma Web Development Codes TAA Malo we are teaching assistants For Sigma Web Development Codes So we can write something like this I have put subtitles And you can also access it And I will show you This is a lot of fun to write subtitles Then write it in your mouth And I will write it in my mouth Malo is a younger person And I don't know who will write in English But he will write it in English He will write it in English Now you can see I have put the text in the form And enter your user name This is our input tag Now we will use the label tag. Now the label is for is equal to my ID. I will tell you the ID user name. And for is equal to my ID, I will add it in for is equal to my ID. Now what is ID? I will tell you the ID. Now you can understand how unique it is. It is an element. It is uniquely identified. You cannot identify the number of your ID. This is how the ID user has got it. Now you can't get any other ID. This is the ID. I have written the label for is equal to user name. You can see the input here. The label will be here. I am looking at the label. I have not added anything in the label. I will enter the user name. You can see the user name. I have added this. You can see the user name. You can enter the user name. You can enter your expertise. You can also enter. I have asked you what is your gender. I can add something here. I can ask you what is your gender. I can ask you what is your gender. What is your gender? I will unwrap it in a div. Div is our block element. What is the block element in this? I have not told you about this. I will tell you in the next video. Now I will add a new space in div. I will add it in div. I will add it in div. It will be in new space. It also has a BR tag. It also has a BR tag. You will get to know why we don't need to upload HTML from our BR tags. We will know the videos coming from our BR tags. You can watch the video coming from our BR tags. Now let's see the user name and the email. Look at the email that I am taking. The email that I am taking is getting ready. The email that I am taking is getting ready. Why it's getting so different? I have added the ID and the knowledge of the email. You can see the ID and the knowledge of the email. You can see the name and the knowledge of the email that I am taking. Name is same. Name is equal to gender. I have also added this input tag. Name is equal to gender. This is also input radio tag. And as we have written the type is equal to radio. And if we have same name, So these two are only one at a time. If I select this, then it will be only one. If I select this, then it will be only one. Now I will show you something. If I add the idea of the level form in the form. And here in the form, I don't add the first one. I add the second one. So when I click on the female, I don't see any select. I don't click, I don't click. I am selecting the male. So to select the female, I have to click here. Look, I want to do it. I always add the ID of the input tag. So you can see here, I have added the label for the female. And here we have an input tag, which is the type is equal to checkbox. Look here, if I add the type is equal to checkbox, then I will add the input. I will add the div in it. I will do it in the format document. I will do it in the format document. I will do it in the format. I will do it in the format. Now look here. Subscribe to Newsletter. I can check it here. And the radio button and checkbox difference is that you can check the checkbox. You can check the checkbox. If you want to see the female, then you can select it. You can select it. Now you have a text area. And select tag. And I will show you what it is. So it is a text area. I will show you what it is. I will show you what it is. It is a text area. So text area is equal to type is equal to text. But it has a rose and column attribute. So you can choose the size of it. Now look here. The placeholder is given the interiors comment. The interiors comment is given in the interiors. Ideally, we will do it in a empty place. Or we will not give it a new line. So I will give it a new line. I will give it a new line. And now you will see the left side. You can see the interiors comment. And you can also put the user comment. Now look at the text area. The content of the content is also in the interiors comment. So you don't want to do this. You want to keep the text area empty. And you want to put a label. And you can say label is equal to comment. And you will definitely add ID. When we put it in the form, The element that is for the ID. Now look here. Now let me write in the interiors comment. So what will happen? I will write the interiors comment. This will come here. Now you can see the style of the content. Because we will style it with CSS. Now I will put just BRTag. I will tell you again. I don't comment on BRTag. Because BRTag is a bit thick. You should know that you should know that you should know that. You should know that you should know that you should know that. But I will tell you. BRTag is something that I don't recommend. I don't want to use it. But I don't recommend using it all the time. I mean, what happens is that people usually use BRTag. And the new spaces that they add. I will post a lot of things. So I will copy it. I will show you select tag. And you can see that As soon as I put the select tag here, I will put it in the div. So what happens in the select? There are some options. Select the syntax. You can use it in a couple of ways. Now you can see that there are some options. And what I have done here is that I have done the value is equal to apple. First I have done the select tag. Then I have done the name is equal to fruits. Then option value is equal to apple. Option value is equal to apple. Option value is equal to cherry. When we will parse this form data, then I will tell you the JavaScript partner. And this is the data that we have to send to server. So about the form, there are a lot of things that are going to be told in the diary. So stay tuned for that. I had told you all the elements of the form about this. And with that, I will tell you all the things that are going to be selected. About the form, from other attributes, you can submit a page on the action. Where will you handle the form? You can send the data there. Then the method is that get request or post request. I will tell you the difference between these two. But I have told you a lot of rough way that get request is very simple request. Post request is used when there is a big amount of data. Because the limit of get request is there. You can send a lot of data in post request. Okay, in get request, we will not send passports. Sometimes we send it with post request. Okay, Now I have told you the method here. What is in name? Name is equal to user name. We mark it with name. If we mark it with name, we will know the server. What is the corresponding value? So the value of the server will be the name. Its name and value will be there. So we will see when we will process server side processing. What does placeholder mean? What does placeholder mean? What does placeholder mean? As you can see here, the user name is placeholder. I will click on it. Enter user name is written inside. I will write something. See, it is here. But enter user name is just here. I want to add user name. Then required means you have to require it. You have to add it. You have to add it. You have to add value. Or you have to submit it. So we will use it a lot. Then we have autofocus. What is autofocus? Autofocus is automatically focused. I will show you autofocus. Then you have to add it. And then you have to add it. Enter user name is autofocus. I will reload it. If I type it, it will focus automatically. So autofocus is the type. You have to type it. You will have to type it. I hope you understand. Now you will know the validation attribute. You can give the pattern you want. You can give the expression pattern. You can confused. You can say, Not like this. We still do this. They may not contain traditional rules. If you find this returns itself Go for your lasts. Because many people ask me that they should not do this course or free course, so they don't value it. They say that it is free, so we will watch it or do a paid course. And I want to give a note to those people who have told me that we have paid course for Europe. They will pay us and join the SIGMA Batch. You can join the SIGMA Batch. Look, what is the quality of this course? I don't think you need to tell me. You all will be able to meet all of you. I am telling you that this course is going to cost Rs.10,000. This was the start of the month we fixed. I was going to sell Rs.10,000 and you all will be able to make this course. And I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course. If there is nothing wrong in selling any course, but the thing is that if you have bought a new course and you feel that SIGMA is a big course. So you should join the SIGMA Batch. Cut your losses and join because you will make your career in the future. You will not get anything. You will see the time when you will come back and you will be able to meet all of us. Yes, we had paid course for this course. Then we had a pre course which we understood. And if you have become a career, you will not get anything in the future. So do what is right for you and you will understand your cycle. I hope you all are understanding. So like the video and access the playlist.
