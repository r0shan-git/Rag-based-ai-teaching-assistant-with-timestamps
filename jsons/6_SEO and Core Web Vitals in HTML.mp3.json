share and subscribe The website of your phone is in the iphone, android phone, surface, etc. Because we have to give good experience to all users In this video we will also know that the hidden tool in the chrome is called lighthouse and you can use it to enhance your website So write in the comment section below, let us know in the comments section below Let's roll the intro in the computer screen So guys, I have already made a new folder in my computer screen which is called video6 Video6 and here is video6 I will open the VS code as always and the thing I am going to tell you today is that SEO is very important to the aspects First of all, I am going to tell you what is SEO SEO stands for search engine optimization If you see any website, then it is SEO Amazon.in's example Many Amazon.in is open So Amazon.in's chart is that the website is loaded quickly so that the products in search can be found in the product Google has a good response to Google that good users can see good pages So Google only wants to show them that fast information is very good and with that, there are some things that good users can see good For example, there are two pages from the side One page has been told about my dog food The other page has also told about the dog food But the page 2 is very low If it is very low, Google will give it a reference With that, there are a lot of vitals which Google considers to rank two pages First of all, content is the most important on the page of content If you have content, you can also rank the core vitals without your website But if you are competing with a such page with the same content, almost similar quality then your core vitals will be seen and if your core vitals are true then you will be given a reference So your core vitals are the first of your CLS You can see this video here which I have run from the web.dev website You can see that someone comes to your website and the order of canceling the cancel has been canceled by the order of the order and this is visible and it has shifted the layout and the order is complete but the user doesn't want to click the order so the user experience is much worse And as you have seen in this video so we should not be less than CLS Now what is the difference between CLS? Cumulative layout shift means there are loads of layers You can see how many layers you have and the first is to see the people and after that when this load is the part of the item, this shift is all inside If you don't want to shift the layout then you should not shift the layout The next metric that we are talking about is the LCP and LCP stands for largest contextual paint This means the user is doing a page view and the biggest element of that page For example, the biggest part of this image is loaded in so many days or the whole page is loaded but the biggest element of that page is loaded in so many days and the goal of that is to have a good LCP score 2.5 seconds and the biggest element of that page is loaded After that is the third metric which stands for first input delay First input delay means that any user has clicked an input on the element on the button or any input on the page then how much input process is there For example, if you click the button the button click browser and the depth of the web and web is 100ms and the input process should start So these are the three core web vitals which are very important For you all, let me tell you which core web vitals are updated but these three are very important and you should know Now I will show you what the light house report is and what are the values of these three core web vitals So I will tell you if you will inspect the right click and you can see you can click on the right-side or you can click on the right-side and you can click on the right-side I prefer this one because I have never seen this before Now you can see the light house option You can see the light house is basically you can generate a report and you can tell you what the HTML page is For example, if I want to see how my mobile users will see how my mobile users will see I will click on the mobile I will click on desktop I will click on the mobile and click on the analyze page You can see that the report is generated Performance, accessibility, best practices, SE and PW You can see there is a red in the scope of improvement in the page You can see you can see you can see the 2.7 second the first side of the website you can see the light house and if you incorporate these your website will be very big You can see the image elements do not have explicit bit than height You should give the image to the bit than height because we have used the previous video so that you can hit the result of the browser and the result will be in the browser Otherwise, if we don't set the height and bit then what will happen that the browser will not know how much space to reserve and how much CSS load will be we don't want to page loading time shift If we start shifting then when we shift we can click here We will click here I will click here and when I click on the same time this image is loaded and it is shifted and when we click on image it says cumulative layout shift This way, shift does not prefer it does not prefer it is less than cumulative layout shift so that we can get a good experience and we get more suggestions for this for desktop report You can see it has a report it has a performance 192 mbps 75mbps You can see that the scope of improvements is a hidden tool which we should use I will tell you about the MetaTexo MetaDiscruption I will make a new file called index.stml and after making a new file I will tell you the title If you are using the content of your page it is a good SEO practice When you are changing your page you should reflect the content If you want to go to Google you can find the title in the code You can find the title and the title and the title which is the YouTube and the Instagram and the title and the title which reflects the content and reflects the content and the website I will add content and I will add H1 and then I will add a paragraph and I will add lorem45 I will add lorem45 I will add a view I will add a very good question I will add Alc and 4 or 5 so I have added 4 or 5 I will add 23 I will review it quickly I will do an opening browser here is a document If I leave it like this it will not be a SEO practice I will write about Harry and I will write in the code and what is the title which reflects the content and what is the work which will improve in Google I will also add light and see what scope of improvements I will add light because there is no such thing which I should improve but when I add images I will add a bit of white I will tell you another trick which you can see in any mobile how your website looks you will know you will see here you will see here you will see in any device you will see you can see in any device you will see in iPhone 12 Pro you will see in the resolution you will see in you phones how can you see how your phone will look in Google phones how long you can find and you want a general views in your website depends on which device you want in loves I'll show you this page. This is the page about which contains description about Harry. And here you can write whatever page content you want. I'll show you what is SEO. You've written what is SEO. Here you can see this page has written this meta description. This is SEO stands for this and symbol terms. Now it's not necessary that a search engine will pass your meta. If you like it, you can pass it here and then you can use it as a meta. If you don't like it, you can also generate your content from it. This is the search engine's responsibility. You'll see what is Google's responsibility. But we should have two points from our side. If we want to write a blog, we can write our organization rank. Here you can see that I've written a meta description. Now it's a meta keyword. But the meta keyword is now deprecated. The meta keyword is not used yet. The meta keyword is seen in some way. But it's believed that the meta keyword is not ranked in SEO. Because people do more than the views. You've written the page about pets and you've written what is SEO. The meta keyword will be ranked in this. I'll show you the double quotes. If I write a meta keyword, it will be necessary that a search engine will be considered. Some search engines say that the meta keyword is not accepted. So the meta keyword is not accepted. But the meta keyword is not accepted. You can pass the page's content. And now it's time to get it. You'll understand the content. What is your value of your content? You'll get ranked. If you want to know about the core web vital. For example, if I inspect and go to the lighthouse and get the light out for the desktop, then some core web vital comes. Like the LCP comes. Then the FCP comes. First contextual paint. You can see that everything is 10000. You can see that there is no more content in this. But you can see that the pages with the websocket cannot enter back forward. In the websocket, we are using extension. Life preview. Otherwise, this is the accessibility. Everything is so-so. PWA is the progressive web apps. We won't make it. But you can see that the first contextual paint. The largest contextual paint. Total blocking time. If you want to know about this, what is the first contextual paint. The user who is going to see it is painted here. If you want to see this, you can go to the web.dev.dev website. You can see that the websocket is learning about these things. What is the thing about these things? You can go to the web. You can go to the web. There is a lot of good content here. But we will focus on the websites of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You should have come to this. I told you about this. If you haven't done the web development series yet, please do access it. Click the playlist and save it on the star. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."}
