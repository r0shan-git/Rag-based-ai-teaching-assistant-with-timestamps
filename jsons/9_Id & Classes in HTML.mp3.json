Bye."}], "text": " In this video I will tell you what are the ideas and classes? The concept of the idea and classes is very confusing In fact, when I was learning HTML, I was very confused in my early days In the idea and classes, the idea was unique identity If you gave an idea, you will not give the idea of the second element But the class means that if you want to give multiple elements, you will give it multiple classes For example, you can give a div to a red name and a form You can also give a form to a form You can also give an article tag to a red name and a header tag Do like this video because we will go to the computer screen and I will see these things closely Let's roll the intro Guys, I am back If you have not access the sigma web development codes, then you can click on the playlist and save them and upload them on the source code You can also make a folder in the folder and the video number 9 I will make a folder in the video I will make a video 9 and make a folder after making a video I will put it in the open window and you can see that this is opened in the BS code I will write an index.html, and then I will enter the file and then I will tell you the ID and classes You will only have a half card, it is not that you have no ID Don't write in the comment that you don't have an ID Whenever you go to any place, you have to show your ID For the sake of proofing your identity, I am here Now you have to understand the ID and classes in the HTML The ID is your identity Listen to a story here This is John and this is Harry These are two good friends They share their lunch and other friends They are not in the case of food These are the other friends You can see that this is John and Harry is the ID of his own This is my number and John's number is similar to this This is John's number and this is my number We both can never be the same If you believe that our friend is my friend Tanya and John's friend is the beginning of the conversation I will tell you the number of his family This is the number of Tanya and this is the number of Tanya Now I will tell you the number of these people John and Harry are friends John's friend is the number of Tanya These four are not the same If I tell you the number of these people I have got 5th, 4th, 5th and you will understand Harry's story If I tell you the number of the people I will tell you the story of the beginning If I tell you the story of the fourth, sixth, fifth, fifth and third You understand Tanya's story So he identifies uniquely This is the number of Tanya, Harry, and John This is the number of these people This is the number of these people We will not get any other number Along with that, I have told John and Harry They read the first class And that class's name is Class 10 I have two 10 Manlouar is called Man And the beginning is the class 9 And Tanya is also the class 9 So both the class 9 Tanya is also the class 9 And the beginning is also the class 9 So the beginning is the class 9 However the first Class can be a typical class Besides you should take a little verse If anything more simple Roll up the read it in this 4th, what would be the next class A total of 1 in class 8 So for a student who has a higher class That would be the second one I would not take a seat Well, another one is to finish one class That is certain For a student He will read first! So, it is a class 10 and a class 10 and also a class 7. It is a class red and it is a class red. So, it is a class red. So, it is a class red. Now, let it be a John Harry Shruti. Let it delete. Let it delete. Now, let's make a div. And I have given it a class red. And I have made a span and I have given it a class red. Okay. I have given it a class that I can give to other elements. But if I want to add ID to any element, I can add ID to this key first. I can add ID to this. I don't want any other element to be added. If it is a dev, then I can't add it. Then I have to add ID to this. I will write it in second and then I will write it in first. Okay. So, I have explained this ID and the concept of class. I personally thought it was very late. When I was learning about map and map, I had learnt it in my early days. I didn't tell anyone that the ID identifies uniquely. And the class can also be applied in multiple classes in one element. And one class can also be applied in multiple elements. You understand? I can give it a red class. I can give it a BGL class. And if we give an element multiple, then we apply it in space. As I want in this element to add multiple classes. So, what I will do? I will write red here. Then I will apply it in space and write it in BGL. So, I can give multiple classes in the same element. Can I give the same element multiple ID? Can I give it a 2,000 card? You have to have a friend. I don't know if you know, but there are no ID. There are no ID cards. There is only one number and there is only one number. You can't be the same person. Okay? You can't be multiple with one person. You can't be the same person. But the class, if I say, which color do you use? You can use a red color t-shirt. You can use it in any type of way. You can go to the market and you will like to play with the kids. You will like to play with the kids. Or you will like to play with the kids. You can choose the class you want. Or they are in the Grapes class. So, we can apply it in class 1. So, I hope you understand. I will write CSS. Don't say that CSS is not a very simple one. I will write in CSS and you will like to understand it. I am writing some alien language. From Style.CSS. But I am trying to make a point. I will click here. The preview is in the first and second. I will show you one thing. I am a class, how to target in CSS and then add a dot rate. And the first step is the idea of a hash, and the first step is the class. If I say that the first step is to background the red. So the first step is to background the red. This is a selector in CSS. And now I don't want to confuse you and I can comment on CSS. But we will learn all these things. Now I will write a background color red. And what I will do in the dot bgll. I have to write dot bgll. I mean class bgll. I will write background color. So I will write it in color red. I will write it in color red. So the color red and background color are all here. So you can use it in CSS. I hope you all will understand this. Now the important thing here is that the idea of a attribute is from an attribute. It is an idea of a attribute and a class attribute. So what are the id classes? Or not elements. Now the id is one more thing. I will tell you what is the id class. If I write a code on Wikipedia and write it in Java, then it is on Wikipedia. So you can see on Wikipedia, in any page, what you can do is how to write a particular link. I will show you how to write it. I will scroll down on another page. And I will inspect the id here. This is the id. I will copy it. And if I add hash tag here and the id, I will enter it and I will bring it here. I will add it in ICD8. I will scroll it and show it to the particular id. I will scroll it and show it to the individual. I will scroll it and show it to the individual. Because I want to bring it to the id. So even in the link, it is an id. You will know that you can generate links. You can write a link and then add an id. If the link is open, then you will focus on the id. Like in this case, you can see that I am entering the id. But you got the point here. You got the point here. I will enter it and I will not go down. I will open the calendar tab. If I reload it, I will not go down. I will scroll it and then open the new tab. And I will scroll it and bring it to the individual. I hope you guys understood the id and class. I will explain it in the video. The id is like a class. It means that one person's property is like red. Or in which class is it? You can get multiple classes in one element. You can get a red color. You can get a background yellow. And the other element is red and background yellow. You can get multiple elements in red. You can get a red class only in fake elements. And you can also get a red class in one element. You can also get a BGL class. I hope you guys understood. So now in this video, I was reading captions and I was getting excited. I told him to give me a round of applause. And he was saying that I will listen to everything in 5 days. I was very excited. I asked him to access it. Name your village land.
