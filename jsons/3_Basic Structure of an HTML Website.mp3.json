You guys are back in Sigma Web Development course. I am really happy that you guys have given so much love to this course. You guys like this high energy. Because for Sigma Free course, this is the likes of Sigma Chats. In today's video, I will explain to you guys basic structure. I will explain to you guys in a website. In that website, you guys will learn a mobile trick. You will learn that you can preview your phone from your website. You guys can tell me in the comments section that you can get HTML or not. That will help me structure this course better. In this video, I will explain the impact of 4GBD. Because it is very fast about 4GBD. In the coming videos, I will also give you guys quizzes. So learn this video carefully and understand all the concepts. Let's go to the computer screen and let's roll the internet. So guys, I am in the computer screen. Now we will talk about how to use the object text, the structure of the object text. So here, I will make a new folder in my folder. I will open the video and click on the open width code. And you guys can see that my theme is blue color. And many people said that blue is not good. Look, the theme is the choice of your choice. If you want to change the color theme, then you can change the color theme. I will use the dark color of the grid up. You can use dark color. For a new file, I will add index.html. We already talked about this. Here, I will write the title of the page and the content. And then I will use the link tag. I can use the MET and write the style.css. That's why I am taking it. And if I write the script.js here. And then I will write the alert from the alert. So I will not tell you the exact same thing. Here, I have put the script tag here. I have just put the script in the body. Then I will put the script in the form of the script.js. And then I will click here and open width browser. So this will come here. And if I write the background red here, then it will be red. I will not tell you all this. Because I have already told you guys. I will tell you guys now that what is the structure of this structure? Why did you write so much? This is a doubt. We can write the title and the content directly. What is the need to write so much? So I will tell you how much you need to write. I will reload it. Look, the content here is here. It is red here. Now you will see that I need to reload the page. Some people ask me why to reload the page. When I reload the page already. So I changed the CSS file. When I change CSS file, I need to reload at the time. If you are using HTML file, you are changing it. You will not need to reload the changes of HTML file. Now I will come back and I will explain. This is a basic structure. We write HTML website. First of all, we write the doc type HTML. Then write HTML tag. Look, this HTML tag is opening tag or closing tag. This is the opening tag of the body or closing tag. This is the opening tag or closing tag of the head. This is the content of the head. HTML content is the content of the head. The title content is the content of the head. Now what is the content of the head? The head is a self closing tag. There are two types of tags in HTML. One is self closing tag. And the other is the pair tag. What is the pair tag? The opening tag is the closing tag. This is the basic structure HTML website. Now you will see that background red is the background red. This is the background red. This is the background red. If I remove the CSS file from here and say it quickly. What will I say? Remove it quickly. And as I will say it quickly. I will have to remove it from here. I will reload the page. You can see here that it is removed. In this way, I can also say JavaScript. Remove it quickly. You can see that I have also become an alert. Okay. So you can also reload it. So this is an alert. This HTML content in CSS and JavaScript was added. This is additionally CSS and JavaScript functionalities. We used this HTML page to link it. And I already told you about the title tag. This is used to set the page title. Now it is not necessary to give you the title here. The search engines use this. The search engines are Google. If you will write here code with Harry HTML. So code with Harry's HTML introduction, HTML working. All the titles I have added are in the background. You can see here the HTML introduction is the title of the page. So these titles are used in search engines and parsed. Now I will change the page. So HTML working is the title. Now I will change the page. You can see here the HTML installation is the title. So titles are changed. As I will change it, it will be changed. As you can see. So HTML pages have not been used only for title. You can see here. This is also used in SEO. And let's tell you what is the content in the page. These people describe the page content. So I am knowing what is the HTML execution. What is the HTML execution? How does HTML execute? So the title of the page is very good. So we will make a website from any framework. We will change the page title. Now here the head section. The title of the page is the metadata. You can see the title. And you can see the link to the conscript. You can see the link to the conscript. And also the meta tags. I will tell you about them. The meta tags are basically the document. HTML document is about the description. The meta description is a very important keyword. You can write it in the page. If you go to my website, you will get a view of the page. The meta description tag is in the video. You can see the meta description tag. If you talk about Google, the meta description is in the video. I want to show you the document. The document is in the header. The tag is in the header. The tag is in the header. The tag is in the header. You can also put the tag in the header. And what differences will I talk about in the course? I used the link to use CSS. The main content of the page is the main content. My company supports the Gray Agents group. You can see the link of the unit. You can check the link in the search files. The main content is HTML now. What will support the group business to do? Call the annotations in the images. The function used by the community group. The public has a command in the database. It says what processes came out. Overture & Names The name is also a description of the attribute. You can hover over the VS code. You can tell about it. I have hovered over the name. I am telling you how to use the attribute. Most of the content in the body, the HTML is copied. You can copy the HTML from the website. You can copy the source code. If I talk about the forms, you can copy the HTML forms. Start the form and modify it. It is very important to copy. As a senior developer, you should know where to copy and how to copy. I am not saying it is a circus. I am not saying it is a circus. This is the same thing. You can type it or copy it. You will prefer to copy it. This is the change that is going to be formed. If you copy and modify, you will save your time. Innovation is not the right way to copy. You can understand the rules. You will copy and paste the things that are going to happen. If you want to copy and paste, you can save your time. The most important part of being a senior developer is to where to copy and paste from. Where to stack and how to paste it from. Where to copy and paste it from. Where to copy and paste it from. I have told you my copy rate statement. But I have told you many times. Now I will tell you about a technique that you will develop this website. You will see it in this mobile. Now listen carefully to the steps. Write, click, terminal, and open IPconfig. If you are in the old version, you can open the command prompt or power shell. Like the enter and mark the IPconfig. You will see the IPv4 address. You will get 19216.819. Now I will copy this IP address. I will copy this IPv4 address. I will write in my settings, Live preview. I will write the local IP host address and file this on the place where I will write my IP address. After doing this, I will restart my VS code. You will have to ensure that you can go to your Wi-Fi settings and network your network. It should not be public network. It should not be private network. You can connect it with Wi-Fi. Now you will see the show preview. You will see the IP address. You will get a slash index.html. I can use this on my phone. I will put this IP address here. I will put 19216.8199. You can get 3000. You can put your port here. You can see the website. The website has been previewed in mobile. This trick is very useful. When we want to preview in mobile, we will see the website in phone.
