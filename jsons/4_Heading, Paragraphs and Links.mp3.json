Please like and share this video with your friends In this video, we will make a small project Which will be a bookmark website This bookmark will help you to get all your favorite websites And you will be able to use it in actual use So let's start quickly In the comment section, click the SIGMA BATCH OP Let's roll the intro So guys, as you can see, I have already made a computer screen And if you haven't even done a playlist access yet, then you can access it The other thing I want to tell you is that you will go to the GitHub.com slash code And you will get the Github repo of the SIGMA webda course Now I have made all the videos of it and made a folder And I have made a completely different folder So you will get access from the source code You will get the link in the description And I will put the link in the description Now we will make a basic website today But it will be very important for us Because it will be our first useful website So I will not take time to take the SIGMA webda course I will make a new folder in this folder And I will keep the video for it because it is our fourth video So I will make a video with the name of the folder And I will click on the open with code to open the folder in our VS code After doing this, I will do the same thing that we always do Index.html, Main.css, Style.css and with that, script.js We usually make these three files If I write CSS, I will write here and write here But for now, I will write some things here I will write in the document My bookmarks I will write the code in the description I will write the code in the description So I will write all the titles Now I will write H1 What happens with H1? You can write the heading in your web page We talked about basic structure We said that it is HTML HTML Lang is equal to EN It is the value of the attribute of the language In English, this is the search engine Or if any of the link of this web page is in the description You can parse the web page from the search engine You can also find out that your web page is in English Here is the header, which is in the metadata, which is title, which is in the description The link of CSS is in the description Body is in the main content Now the tag is in the tag that is in the name of H1 And I will write the code in the description If I write here, I will write the code in the description So we will write H1 tags And if I want to live here I will click here And after that I will do an open and browser See this is showing my bookmarks in this way Now why should we always use H1? I directly wrote my bookmark Because I will tell the browser This is my heading and this is my first level heading Now I will choose the second level heading in my bookmarks I want to write a main bookmark and a secondary bookmark So I will use H2 That is, the second level heading So if you write it in your book, if you have a word use Then you will know what H1H2 is I will tell you the main level heading And the second level heading It is from H2 I will say the main bookmarks And the secondary bookmarks I will do something like this And I will do something like this I will do an alt shift And I will do an alternate script I will do a screen cast mode So I have done an alternate script And this is the replicate This is the shortcut of the VS code I want to tell you the shortcut of VS code And you will be able to click and see the cursor Like I said, click on the far east And you will only have a cursor But you can click the alt If I click more, then you will be able to see the cursor And I want to add all the bookmarks And I want to add the reference code So I will add the reference code I will write something like this I have not done this Then click the Alt And I will click on the Alt And then I will type whatever kind of cursor and I have taken 6\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 headlights, the H7U will never grow if I say in practical life you might be able to use S6 MP's I will click here, I will add all the buttons, I will add this to H4 Ok, and I will click here, I will add H5 Ok, I will click here, I will click here, I will click here, I will add H6 So H6 is the same, what I will do now? I will write here using H1, so that you know I will write here using, I will write here, I will add space, I will write using, H And now I will click my camera, and I will write here 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 And now you can see something like this You will know that I have H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H5, H6, H6 And what is the small thing that is going to end, then it will be ready So H6 is more than enough, so I will show you a practical demonstration I have told you that my HTML tutorial is here, I have given the main adding, HTML introduction Then I have given you what HTML, then features of HTML I have given this from H1, this is from H2 This is from H2, I have given it from H2, I have given it from H3 There is something inside, like here, why the term hypertext and markup language was This is heading 2, what is the main adding page of HTML introduction After this, all these are heading, I had given it a quick exercise So I have used H3 inside, then in the back there is H2 Because inside of this, the hierarchy that is built in H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 are used, okay, I hope you all understood People are commenting, you are starting very slow, then we come I am making this course as a beginner course When I tell you in HTML, then you all are saying, this is very easy I will tell you a little CSL, you all are saying, this is also coming Then I will call it JavaScript, this is okay, I will come a little bit Then I will come a bootstrap, this is also, this will go, I will show you Then I am reacting, what is happening? Then I will note the JST, then I will go to Munga D and then I will see the same Then after that, it will go up, I told you that I will raise the bell Then I will raise the bell like anything, this is what I meant So when we will react, when we will make projects, when we will do dangerous things Then I will ask them to comment, you tell me what level is it Okay, then don't talk about level, level is going to rise, it will be very big So this is the heading, the 6 addings that I want to keep like this Now if we want to write paragraph, then you can use P tag P entermaring, this paragraph will be there, now I will tell you a shortcut trick If you want to play Dummy paragraph in the MS code, then what will you do? You write here, I said that I wrote the LORM 23 And here you see, the M at abbreviation is here, this is the LORM 23, I will give 23 words In some way, you can trap the word on view, then you will not get the horizontal straw bar So you can trap this view, now you see here, the LORM EPSAM dollar set is here, this is a Dummy text Dummy text, why do we want, because we are making template And we have to fill that template with something, we have to make a website And that is the OEO rooms, now OEO become a member, OEO for business I don't know, I wrote LORM here, now I want to write something here, I write 7 words in LORM 7 I will give OEO to the LORM 7 and I will write it as I will do it So you can use this in the placeholder, My plan is that we will also make popular websites, so that you know what to do And also a lot of popular websites, if you use these services, you must write in the bottom section Now we will see more things, like paragraph, how to style it, and all these things are done through CSS Now in paragraph, you can see that I wrote LORM 23, I will enter here, if I will, I will write LORM 10 So I will write 100, if I want LORM 100, I will write much more, I will go full page, then I can do it So this LORM value is very good, you will enjoy it, and whenever we will make popular websites, I will make Amazon.in I will make Amazon.in So I have to write something here, now I will write 3 words here, so I will write LORM 3 I will not think about makeup products, I will write LORM 4, I will write LORM 3, I will write LORM 2 And I will make it and then I will do everything that comes from my database, and I will bring it from different types of things Many people asked me, what is this course job ready, the answer is yes, this course job is ready Absolutely, I will make it like this, that you will get the job of the job in actual industry, and the learning of this course will be completed Now let's talk about what are the attributes in HTML, these attributes are in HTML, like I used HTML tag, the language is equal to the attribute in the language In the body, we did not use attribute, in H1 we did not use attribute, in P we did not use attribute, but I can use a P-Make style attribute I will read the background color, so that the background color is red, we will also say it in the online CSS, through the style attribute If you add CSS, first we will add CSS here, but if you add style, then you will get background red here, I will show you this red red background I will tell you that I will do this, I will do this, then I will do this color, then I will add style in the online CSS, but when you make the website of the industry, we will use it very less Because it is maintained, it is used as a reusability, so we want to shift from small to small bundles on browser And the website is more optimized, so we will avoid all these things, but in the online CSS, there is a style tag, but here there is a style attribute, P is a tag, we can style this element through which we can add this element, we will read about more attributes, Attributes basically, we will give an enhanced functionality to this, this is the paragraph we gave a style, which was the background color, We used this style attribute to give a style, we will use this type of tag to give properties, Like if we talk about link, link colon CSS, link relic attribute, so what we can do with this attribute, we can add CSS style sheet, I will show you the background color, background color, background color, background color, and don't take tension, I will comment on this style sheet, which is very natural, the background color was coming from this style sheet, This background color was coming from the online CSS, which is very natural, which is very normal, Here I have made this style is equal to the background color, which is the background color, Now we are going to make a bookmark manager, bookmarkmanager.html, and I am making a different file, I will show you the different settings, I am going to make a useful bookmark manager, Bookmark manager, why are you making bookmark manager in a chrome? This is our hand, this is our child, we have made it, so you have to be prepared for it, Because this is the software you have created, you have created a software, You can see here, I will write bookmark manager in the bookmark, I will write it in h1, and I will write my bookmark, I will write my bookmark, I will write h2, I will write my primary bookmark, and I will write h2 from h2, In fact, I will write here in all shift bottoms, I will write here in secondary bookmark, I will write in paragraph 1, I will write google, I will write google, I will write it in list, But in the next video, I will tell you how to use list, Now you can use google, I will write google, open google, and I will use anchor, I will use this in the case, I will enter in A, and I will write h1, I will write h1, I will write h3tps colon double slash www.google.com, and I will write h3 from this address, I will cut this open google, and I will write here, Because the content stack will be like this, and you can see here, This is h3 from open google, I will write this anchor, I will write here anchor, and I will write here in bookmark manager dot html, You can see here, I will write here in bookmark, and I will write here in google, You can see here, I have not written here, I have visited this blue, I have visited this blue, and I have changed this color, This color changes when you visit it, I have already converted a visited link, I know that I have visited it, Now I will tell you one more thing, If you want to open this new tab, I am clicking it on it, it is open in that tab, If you want to open it in a new tab, then you can open it in two ways, You can also use mouse wheel, This mouse can also be clicked, In the second way, I will tell you, If you want to use a click, then you can use it in a new tab, You can write here, Target is equal to underscore blank, And VS could give suggestions, I have written two enter marks, I write in a note pad, Some other sister editor, What was the quality of the test, Free VS could be, but if you use sister editor, Target is equal to underscore blank, You have to type the entire blank, it will be a little bit empty, But if you write it in any way, What will happen, I will click now, I am clicking, I am not clicking mouse wheel, I am clicking, I will click on the new tab, If I click mouse wheel, then I will open it in my new tab, So I can open it in this way, I have written a simple open google, If you want, then you can use it in your own custom website, Which is your favorite website, You can use it here, Okay, I have put it in a good website, Now I will write open facebook, And here you can see www.facebook.com And I know that I write here, Kora.com and Code withery.com And then we will put it here, Let us see from which website I am putting it in, youtube.com Let's see, why is this not here, You can see that this is coming in one line, Okay, if you want this line to not come in one line, So what will you do now, You will put it in your own paragraph, This is a very dirty way, I am saying this dirty way, I will tell you ahead, But close this paragraph, And I will shift the button, I will control the right arrow, Then I will end the button, And all the cutters will go in the end, Because if you are on a cutter, And I will control it, Now I have shot it, And you will see how it will go, What is this, if you do not do it, But I have simply done that, The functionality of VS Code is used, Multiple cutters are used, And I have used it, This is not a good way to use the paragraph, We do not even get a list, We make a list, But because we do not have a list, We will work on it, And what we did not visit, The Facebook visit, We have printed on it, So now from your primary bookmarks, Which one of your second bookmarks are you? We are two second bookmarks, Second bookmarks are only available, Which you will visit at any time, Follow wikipedia.com And follow stackoverflow.com We will write in the first, Stack Overflow, Stack Overflow, And you can see, You have wikipedia and Stack Overflow. So this is your bookmark manager, And you can make this bookmark manager better. If we learn from CSS, If you are looking for a next one, Don't worry, It is a very big mistake, Because we will do the time-striking, And do the designing, And we will talk about it. Now you will see how your bookmark works. The code is also in your title, And I will write it in H1, And I will write it in my bookmarks code. So you can make a bookmark manager from this way. You can use it in actual use. And if you save it in some way, Like I have got this bookmark manager on RdHD. And you can put it on your desktop, When you open a website, You will simply double click it. If you double click it, And open it via scots, You will have to do it rightly, Open with it, You will have to wrap the shoes in it, Always do it, Like I will do Google Chrome, And I will always do it. So whenever I double click it, I will open it with Google Chrome. So this is our bookmark manager, I hope you liked it. I hope you liked it. I hope you liked it. I hope you liked it. Today our 4 videos are complete. If you like any code, I hope you share it with your friends. I know you will share it, I will find the ways to make more money. But the thing is, I am going to mark this code, Because this is the biggest code of Web development. With everything. I will put everything in it. And you will learn more from less time. I have been very late to get late. I had told all the companies to launch this. I will not say that many companies are late. And they told me that They launch this as a paid code. Why are you doing this? You will regret your decision. You will learn more from this code. And you will learn more from this code. How can you earn more money from this code? With that said, I will put the description in it. You can take it from the repository. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Thanks for watching this video."}
